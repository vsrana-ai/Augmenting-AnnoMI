0,Thanks for filling it out. We give this form to everyone once a year regardless of why they come in. It helps us provide better care. Is it okay if I take a look at what you put down?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1,"So, let's see. It looks that you put-- You drink alcohol at least four times a week on average-",reducing alcohol consumption,1
2,Okay. That's at least 12 drinks a week.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
3,"Uh, what else can you tell me about your drinking.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
4,"Okay. So, can I share with you some information on alcohol use?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
5,"Okay. So, there has been a lot of research on alcohol use and the guidelines we use in this country says that having seven or more drinks per week can raise the risk of health problems for women.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
6,"Yeah, you're surprised to hear that?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
7,"Well things like heart disease, cancer, liver problems, uh, stomach pains, insomnia. Unfortunately, uh, people who drink at a risky level are more likely to be diagnosed with depression and alcohol can make depression worse or harder to treat.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
8,Okay. And how do you feel after you drink?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
9,"So, there are some answers on this form here. Uh, less than monthly you drank more than you intended to.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
10,And sometimes you feel guilty after you drink.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
11,So you're not proud of finishing a bottle?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
12,Where do you wanna go from here? What do you wanna change about your drinking habits?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
13,"If I gave you a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to cut back on drinking and 10 being very ready, what number would you be at?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
14,Okay. Why do you think it's not something less like a six?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
15,What would help you cut back to two drinks?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
16,Having less wine in the house will help?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
17,What else besides drinking helps you relax and unwind in the evenings?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
18,"So, it's not just wine that helps you relax. Um, there's reading a book, watching a movie, and taking a hot bath too.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
19,"Okay. So, it sounds like you have some reasons to cut back on drinking and you have ways to relax besides drinking and it sounds like you're pretty ready to cut back.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
20,Great. I'd be interested to see how well you do on your goal in the next few weeks. Would you be willing to come back and talk to me about it?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
21,"Great. So, let's see how well you're doing with these new meds.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
22,"And before you leave, uh, is it okay if we go over this screening form that you filled out today on your alcohol use?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
23,"Okay. Uh, thanks for filling this out. Uh, looks like you use alcohol two to three days a week?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
24,"Okay. And then when you do drink alcohol, you typically have five or six drinks.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
25,"Okay. Well, the reason why I like to talk to patients when they fill out this form is because sometimes, uh, alcohol use can impact our health. Um, and my role is to be helpful. I can share some information with you about alcohol use, um, but I don't tell anyone what to do. It's always up to the patient to decide what they wanna do about their drinking. Um, so is it okay if we talk a little bit more about your alcohol use?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
26,How would you define drinking too much?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
27,So a limit of four a night doesn't feel right to you?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
28,"You're not alone in feeling that way. Uh, binge drinking can feel normal to some people.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
29,"Mm-hmm. Well, technically, we define binge drinking as having more than four drinks on one occasion.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
30,"Well, uh, we know if someone binge drinks over time, there's kind of two categories of risk. There's the short-term risk where someone who binge drinks is more likely to fall down, hurt themselves through an accident, uh, they're more likely to drive while under the influence. Uh, but over the long term, binge drinking can also, uh, cause things like heart disease, uh, different kinds of cancer, liver problems obviously, and then even mental health issues like depression and anxiety are more likely to happen.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
31,"Can I ask you, uh, what do you like about drinking alcohol?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
32,And so what about your drinking do you not like or is there anything that worries you about your drinking?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
33,"So, on one hand, you like how beer tastes, uh, it's part of your social life to some extent, um, but on the other hand, you don't like the idea of it posing risks to your health over the long term?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
34,"So weighing those things, you know, what you like about your drinking, what you don't like about your drinking, uh, where do you wanna go from here? Uh, what would you like to change about your drinking?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
35,"Well, how about hypothetically if I were to ask you, how would your drinking have to impact your life in order for you to be ready to change your drinking?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
36,"Okay, great. See you next time.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
37,You got your lip pierced. How long ago did you get that done?,better oral health,1
38,What made you decide to get-get a lip piercing?,better oral health,1
39,"Um, I guess, you know, as your dentist, I have- I have a couple of concerns about lip piercings, oral piercings. I wonder what have you heard about how having an oral piercing can affect your-your teeth or your gums?",better oral health,1
40,You do. you have beautiful teeth as I always tell you-,better oral health,1
41,"Um, I mean I have had some patients with oral piercings and they can erode some of the gum right, um, just right there at the front.",better oral health,1
42,"Um, so that's one-one thing, and the other is, um, I do see fair amount of chipped teeth-",better oral health,1
43,"Yeah. There's certainly been-- There's no problems and you, as you said, only have had it for a short time.",better oral health,1
44,"Um, what would- what would make you decide, ""This is something that's not right for me?""",better oral health,1
45,"Yeah, it looks nice. So, you want to monitor it and-and-",better oral health,1
46,"Emily, you said it so well it-",better oral health,1
47,"-the-the piercing might not last forever, but your teeth really are-",better oral health,1
48,"-hopefully forever. So, okay, well thanks for-for talking about it-",better oral health,1
49,"-with me, and also before I do the exam, you know, I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we can take [inaudible 00:02:46]-",better oral health,1
50,"Hi, Sal. Thanks for coming in today.",asthma management,1
51,"I saw that your doctor made the referral and, um, and I really appreciate you taking the time to come and make that appointment.",asthma management,1
52,So you made it in here-,asthma management,1
53,- and do you have a sense of-of what some of the doctor's concerns were that led her to refer you?,asthma management,1
54,"So your asthma has been acting up and there's a lot of stuff, not just the asthma going on?",asthma management,1
55,"Well, we have about, I guess, 15 or 20 minutes together and I wonder, would it be okay, if we took a couple of minutes and just kind of looked at all of the different things that are going on for you and maybe you can let me know, what would be the most helpful to spend-spend some time on?",asthma management,1
56,"Okay. Well, one of the things that-that we use are these-- it's kind of like a worksheet and it's an agenda-setting worksheet basically.",asthma management,1
57,"It really-- You're in the driver's seat, so it's just to kind of put all the cards on the table, so to speak.",asthma management,1
58,"So your dog, and-and the doctor's saying the dog's—",asthma management,1
59,That's pretty shocking to be told that you have to get rid of your dog.,asthma management,1
60,Hmm. So that's a huge stress right now?,asthma management,1
61,"Okay, so smoking and-and I'm working towards quitting completely sounds like that's a goal for you?",asthma management,1
62,"Right. Right, right. So the appointments and time.",asthma management,1
63,"Right. Well, so where would you-- I mean, if you-you had to pick somewhere, one or two kind of high priorities or-or things to talk about in our time this morning, where would you wanna start?",asthma management,1
64,"Okay, and those are ones that are pretty related to each other-",asthma management,1
65,So I know we've determined that you sprained your ankle yesterday and I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit about how that happened?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
66,"No, I guess that that would be the end of your, uh, shaking and moving. I know-- I wonder if you'd be open to exploring your alcohol use and what that looks like during the week.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
67,You're still feeling the effects of-,reducing alcohol consumption,1
68,So what is a typical week for you as far as your alcohol use?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
69,So a few drinks is nothing new to you?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
70,And what does a few drinks look like? Is that per night? Is it two drinks?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
71,All right. Do you have any concerns at all about your alcohol use?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
72,Would you be open to kind of looking at the low-risk drinking alcohol guidelines?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
73,"-and what the safe limits are for women is 10 drinks for women a week with about two drinks, uh, per day.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
74,Where do you- where do you feel you fall into that?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
75,"Okay, so it's kind of a way to cope through stress?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
76,"Right, and is that something that has been, you know, a way of coping for a while?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
77,Okay. Does that concern you at all?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
78,Do you feel like you have any reasons to kind of bring your alcohol use down within the limits?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
79,"I'd love to, uh, set up an appointment for you if you can come in later this week or early next week to-",reducing alcohol consumption,1
80,#NAME?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
81,"So, what brings you here, Bob? What's, what can I do to help?",smoking cessation ,1
82,"So, let me ask you this, Bob, what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking?",smoking cessation ,1
83,"Wow, that she's been showing you and making you read.",smoking cessation ,1
84,"So, you're pretty angry about it. It's pretty outraging that you're forced to change your whole life because of a decision she made six months ago.",smoking cessation ,1
85,"So, from your perspective, do you see any consequences to your smoking?",smoking cessation ,1
86,"So, let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario 'cause there's a lot of pieces to it. Your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too. So, you're sort of isolated, you're put in a corner and you're being told this is something you have to do, you have no choice in the matter.",smoking cessation ,1
87,"You have a few concerns about your health, but that's not really the driving force. It sounds like it's most of all that it would be nice if things just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore. Does that pretty much sum up--?",smoking cessation ,1
88,I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you. That you would do anything.,smoking cessation ,1
89,"So, it strikes me that the way that we're talking about it, it's like it's all or nothing. Either you keep smoking the way you are, things continue to go downhill and get worse, your wife gets more and more on your case, or you put your cigarettes down starting the moment you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again. It's almost like one or the other. It strikes me that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking.",smoking cessation ,1
90,There are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt. Recognizing that it-it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be.,smoking cessation ,1
91,"If you wanted to bring your wife along, I'd be more than happy to talk with both of you.",smoking cessation ,1
92,"So now that we've discussed a little bit of your medical history and- and taking your vitals, I'd like to ask you a few more questions. The-",reducing alcohol consumption,0
93,"-the rise in your blood pressure is concerning to me, so I'd like to gather a bit more information about your lifestyle.",reducing alcohol consumption,0
94,Okay. Have you had any major stressful events recently or any change in your work situation?,reducing alcohol consumption,0
95,"Yeah, that's certainly true. I'd also like to ask about some health habits that can contribute to high blood pressure.",reducing alcohol consumption,0
96,"Okay, do you smoke at all?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
97,"Okay, great. Um, do you drink alcohol, including beer or wine?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
98,"Okay. Well, I'm concerned about the amount that you're drinking currently. It sounds like you're having about 15 to 20 drinks per week, and that's definitely more than what we would recommend and could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure.",reducing alcohol consumption,0
99,"Well, according to your chart, your blood pressure has gone up since July, and you said that you've been drinking more recently, so do you see the connection there?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
100,"Alcohol can have some dangerous effects on your body. So along with contributing to high blood pressure, it can have a big impact on your liver, which you need to keep in mind. So your liver has several different roles in your body. First, it helps process excess fatty acids before they get distributed to the rest of your body. It also helps process alcohol and other drugs. So when you have an excess of alcohol, your liver can't work as efficiently and the fatty acids build up, and over time, your liver won't be able to work as well.",reducing alcohol consumption,0
101,"Okay. And how about the use of other drugs like cocaine, heroin, marijuana?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
102,"Okay. And then we'll set up an appointment for about a month from now. We'll recheck your blood pressure and see how you're doing with all this, sound okay?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
103,"Okay. Um, what brings you in?",diabetes management,0
104,Mm-hmm. I see- I see that your A1C or your blood glucose is very high.,diabetes management,0
105,"Mm-hmm. Well, you do need to take your medicine. We, uh, will need to start dieting, uh, you know, lose some weight, change-change your eating habits, exercise, uh, to get your diabetes under control, because your doctor is right, it is very serious.",diabetes management,0
106,"So, uh, you know, we-we need to start looking at doing all those different things to get your diabetes under control 'cause your-your number is very high.",diabetes management,0
107,Okay. So about how much are you smoking over the course of a day? You had said it had increased over once or twice a day.,smoking cessation ,1
108,"Okay. So about eight cigarettes. So over the course of a day, just under half a pack?",smoking cessation ,1
109,Okay. And that's changed over what period of time?,smoking cessation ,1
110,"Okay. So over the past year, the smoking has increased. And that's been mainly in the evening?",smoking cessation ,1
111,"Mm-hmm. Well, that's the time when you can relax and unwind.",smoking cessation ,1
112,"Yeah, exactly. You know, I told you, my-my schedule is kinda crazy right now. I, um, I work full-time and I just started back at night classes. So, you know, all that combined, you know, I enjoy that time to myself in the evening.",smoking cessation ,1
113,"Sure. Sure. Well, it's a time to relax and you've got a lot going on.",smoking cessation ,1
114,So are there other things you do in the evening to relax?,smoking cessation ,1
115,Okay. A drink or two. So about how many drinks would you say you have over the course of a day?,smoking cessation ,1
116,Two max. How many drinks would you say you'd have over the course of a week?,smoking cessation ,1
117,"No, I understand- I understand. And I'm certainly not here to tell you what to-to do, Sarah. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and sharing some information with you, and what you do with that information is totally up to you. You've got a lot going on. You're a mother, you're working, you're going to school, and our healthcare team wants to make sure that you have all the resources available to you to meet your goals, including good health. And my job as your healthcare provider is to listen to you and to share information with you, including healthcare concerns associated with smoking and alcohol. Would that be okay with you?",smoking cessation ,1
118,#NAME?,smoking cessation ,1
119,So you're consciously trying to cut back.,smoking cessation ,1
120,About a five. So you're halfway there. So why did you choose a five rather than a four?,smoking cessation ,1
121,"Okay. So you-- that's cutting back quite a bit. That's a big step. So since we're kind of running out of time here today, I'm wondering if we could-- would be willing to come back in about four weeks to review this plan?",smoking cessation ,1
122,"Okay. Well, I've got a brochure here and this has-- it's a really good brochure. It has some distraction techniques in it in case you get those nicotine cravings. So it's-",smoking cessation ,1
123,"-been helpful, um, in-- with patients before. I'd also like to ask you, would you be willing to see one of our counselors?",smoking cessation ,1
124,"Well, Dr. Kirtley is one of our counselors and he is an expert in-- at discussing the association between alcohol and stress. I want to share something with you. The National Guidelines recommend that women have no more than seven drinks of alcohol per week to-to stay at that low risk level, to avoid the healthcare concerns that we spoke of earlier.",smoking cessation ,1
125,"You've indicated that your alcohol consumption is a bit higher than that, putting you at risk. So that's why I asked if you'd be willing to talk to Dr. Kirtley.",smoking cessation ,1
126,"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I wanted to let you know that at this appointment, we're gonna be giving Lilly some vaccines.",taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
127,Hmm. Can you tell me more about your concerns about vaccines?,taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
128,"Okay, so you were thinking that maybe exposing Lily naturally to these diseases would be a better choice than using vaccines to help her get stronger?",taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
129,"That's right. Having chickenpox as a child means that you are less likely to have chickenpox as an adult because you've developed a-a natural immunity. Uh, but is it okay if I offer you a little bit more information about the other vaccines that we're- we were going to give her Lily today?",taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
130,"Okay. So, uh, before vaccines were developed, often when children had a natural exposure to some of these diseases, they ended up with, uh, sometimes death, disability, measles caused brain damage and, uh, deafness and blindness. Polio caused, uh, paralysis in children. And so, allowing children to have natural exposure to these diseases, sometimes was a little bit of a gamble, it could be dangerous.",taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
131,It's really important for you to make sure that she's protected and that you make good decisions and do your research before you make any medical decisions for her.,taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
132,"We don't really recommend that. The idea is you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit, so then you wouldn't be smoking at work, but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either.",smoking cessation ,0
133,"Well, to be honest with you, you mentioned the patch. I can't recommend a patch to you if you're gonna continue smoking. That can actually be pretty dangerous for you. In order to advise you about this at all, I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now.",smoking cessation ,0
134,"Well, there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings, and probably the gum would be the best option for you. It's not something you would continue to use continuously throughout the day, however, but gum is something you use just when you have a craving.",smoking cessation ,0
135,"Well, aside from the gum, you could try the nicotine lozenge, that would be another option for you. Again, that's not something you'd wanna use continuously throughout the day. The nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement, but again, that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke.",smoking cessation ,0
136,"So, Rick, just in regards to your flatmate situation at the moment with Tristan. Uh, you know, we talked about how walking through this program and with the support of your parents and having some positive influence to help you through this. I just want to rethink a bit if you stay living with Tristan. What are the sort of pros and cons of that? What are the good things about living there, what are the not-so-good things about living there?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
137,"Yeah. So, in terms of being supportive and a sort of support you're gonna need to make these changes.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
138,"Okay. What are some of the pros and cons about moving in with whāna, moving in with your auntie and uncle?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
139,"In terms of that freedom and in charge of yourself, and the changes that we're talking about, and building your own family, and to enable you to do that, where do some of that freedom stuff sit with re-engaging back with your whānau and your children, your partner? Is it something you're gonna wanna hang on to, or how you're going to manage that?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
140,"Okay, so I'm just gonna ask you a couple of more background questions.",reducing alcohol consumption,0
141,Okay. How about in the last year?,reducing alcohol consumption,0
142,"Okay. So it sounds like you're drinking about four times a week, anywhere between three and eight drinks on a given day. So, maybe around 20 drinks a week?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
143,"Do you, um, do you ever use any prescription medicines that were not prescribed for you, or ever use your own prescriptions in a way on which they were not prescribed?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
144,"Okay. So, you know, as we said before, you're drinking-- it sounds like you're drinking about 20 drinks a week, over the course of a few days. And I did want to point out to you that the recommended limit for women is actually no more than seven drinks a week, and no more than three on a given day.",reducing alcohol consumption,0
145,"So you're doing more than that right now. And when you drink more than this amount, it puts you at risk for a number of things, okay? Things like greater risk of injury, damage to different parts of your body, um, just a bunch of different problems. And, uh-- so I'm going to recommend that you cut down- cut down that amount to the recommended limit. Again, that's no more than seven drinks a week and no more than three on a given day. Do you think you could do that? Would that be a good goal for you?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
146,"Yeah. Well, it's possible you strained your ankle as a result of the alcohol. You know, it can actually affect your balance and stability. So, really, you know, for where you are right now, you're drinking a good amount more than what's recommended. And, you know, I want you to be healthy. And I don't want to see you coming back in here for something else. So I'm really gonna recommend that you try to cut down to that amount. So, do you think you could do that, cut down to no more than three drinks on a given day?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
147,"So, it sounds like, you know, the amount you drink is pretty normal-",reducing alcohol consumption,0
148,"-amongst the people you typically drink with. But these limits are-- they're actually recommended for all adults. And studies have shown that when you drink more than this, it creates a bunch of problems like we talked about. So, you know, why do you think you drink the amount you drink?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
149,"Well, I think you can still have fun within these amounts. So that's what I'm gonna recommend. Um, I think this is a really good goal, and hopefully, we won't see any more injuries. Okay? So why don't you try that?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
150,All right. Thank you so much.,reducing alcohol consumption,0
151,So I wrote a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden.,smoking cessation ,1
152,"Um, I did wanna talk to you though. I'm a little bit concerned looking through his chart of how many ear infections he's had recently. And I-I noticed that you had checked the box that someone's smoking in the home. So I was wondering if you can tell me a little more about that.",smoking cessation ,1
153,You have a lot of things going on and smoking's kind of a way to relax and destress.,smoking cessation ,1
154,Sure. And it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him. Why did you make that decision?,smoking cessation ,1
155,"So on the one hand, you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the other hand, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems?",smoking cessation ,1
156,What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant?,smoking cessation ,1
157,"Right now, though, it feels almost too difficult to even manage or even to try?",smoking cessation ,1
158,How were you successful when you quit before?,smoking cessation ,1
159,Mm-hmm. The risks were so scary then that you were able to stop?,smoking cessation ,1
160,But they don't feel as scary to you now?,smoking cessation ,1
161,You're doing the best you can do.,smoking cessation ,1
162,Okay. But it sounds to me too like part of you really does want to quit?,smoking cessation ,1
163,It's on your to-do list. It's just not making it to the top?,smoking cessation ,1
164,"If you did decide to quit on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident, and you don't think you could do it and 10 is you feel pretty certain that you could, where do you think you fall right now?",smoking cessation ,1
165,"Well, what made you say five rather than two or three?",smoking cessation ,1
166,Where do you think we should go from here?,smoking cessation ,1
167,"Sure. Well, if you'd be interested, that's something I can definitely talk to you about. There are a lot of new options that can actually help people be way more successful in their attempt at quitting. There's different medications you can try.",smoking cessation ,1
168,"Okay. There's also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other people to go through it with you. And sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it, especially for people like you where smoking is such a stress reliever.",smoking cessation ,1
169,Sure. It feels like something that would take up a lot of time and maybe not fit into your life. I wonder if we could talk about some options that might fit into your life.,smoking cessation ,1
170,"Okay. Well, if you're willing, then we could set up another appointment where you could come in and we could talk more about that.",smoking cessation ,1
171,"Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
172,"So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
173,"All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
174,"Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
175,Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
176,"Great. And, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
177,"All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
178,You like to have a good time?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
179,"And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
180,"That's a good way to be, right?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
181,What's important to you about your family?,reducing alcohol consumption,1

359,"Well, Nina, you know yourself best, and you know, you know, you know what your world looks like and what those, you know, like, you know the support that your friends give you and the support that you get from your family, you know that. And I-I really just wanna support you in being able to make those choices and have those conversations, and I wanna do whatever I can to support you with that. Um, and I'm just wondering if maybe we can kind of pick this up, um, in a next visit, but before we go there, I'm just wondering, is there some steps that you would be willing to kind of take or consider, uh, with-with regards to your drinking?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
360,"You're concerned about the health of your baby. I just would love to share with you, Nina, that every day without alcohol is a good day for your baby, and you know, starting today to have zero alcohol is a great start, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of something you'd be open to as no more alcohol at this point.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
361,"Okay, sounds like this is really important to you. You want to make this happen.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
362,Is there anything that I can support you with before we wrap up as far as giving up alcohol today?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
363,You kind of got a reality check today.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
364,"You did really well talking with me today, and I thank you so much for just sharing your heart.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
365,"Hi, Sarah, it's great to meet you. My name is Delwyn, and I'm a counselor here at the clinic. And I heard from your nurse practitioner that you recently had an annual exam in which the topics of smoking and alcohol use came up. Would you mind filling me in a little bit about that?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
366,"So, you've decided you wanna cut back on your smoking a little bit, but, you're not really concerned about your drinking.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
367,It's a nice sort of form of stress relief.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
368,Sort of escape from your hectic schedule.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
369,"So, you're working, and then, on top of that, juggling being a single mom and going to school?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
370,"Yeah, it does. It sounds like a lot that you're trying to deal with, and it makes sense that you feel like you need some kind of break or reward.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
371,"So, you're drinking, perhaps, two drinks a day. Um, and I'm wondering, what have you heard about the recommendations for drinking levels?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
372,"Okay, will you be interested in hearing about those recommendations?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
373,"Okay. Well, so, the recommendation for women is to have no more than three drinks a day, and no more than seven drinks over the course of a week. Yeah, um, and, really, the reason for those recommendations is to just reduce the risk that people have trouble with accidents, or chronic diseases. Like certain types of cancers, or high blood pressure, and then also psychological problems. I don't know what you think about all that?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
374,"It just doesn't seem that abnormal to you, especially when you compare it with your family.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
375,"Yeah, you really feel like you need that reward.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
376,"And then it also sounds like, um, your drinking has perhaps increased a little bit over time?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
377,"So, let me summarize a little bit what you've told me. It sounds like you have a pretty hectic, stressful life, and you really feel like you need some kind of-",reducing alcohol consumption,1
378,"-reward or stress relief. Um, and then, on the other hand, you've noticed, um, that your drinking has increased a little bit over time. And also that the more stressed you're fe- you feel, the more you're inclined to drink.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
379,"So, I'm wondering, have you noticed any problems from your drinking?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
380,"So, you've noticed that it's starting to call to you a little bit in the evenings.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
381,"Yeah. And so, it sounds like there's a bit of a dilemma there, because-- And I guess we should be clear, it's not the occasional drink that's an issue. Um, it's-it's really the quantity of drinking, and-and whether your drinking is escalating and interfering with things that are, perhaps, more important.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
382,And you've perhaps never seen it in that light before.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
383,"So, it seems like it would be really difficult to change because it's something that's really important to you right now.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
384,"So, I guess I'm wondering if you've given any thought to other ways in which you could cope with stress without relying on the drinking so much.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
385,"So, if you could somehow tackle some of these stressful issues, um, that could make a difference, and, what-what would that be, for example?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
386,"So, having more reliable childcare could make a big difference.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
387,"And it sounds like your mom has been an option in the past, but perhaps not so much anymore.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
388,"So, one thing that could make a big difference is if you could figure out some sort of more reliable, affordable childcare, and that would help you not want to drink as much.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
389,"Yeah. It-it sounds like, um, you know, money could make a big difference, and you are working full time and trying to go to school to address that in the long run. Um, but on the other hand, you know, it sounds like you have some other ideas of cope- of how you might cope with stress better. Um, so, I guess I'm-I'm wondering, given our conversation so far, kind of where you are with everything.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
390,"Um, we started off talking about how your drinking has sort of drifted into a risky area, and it would be advisable to cut back. Um, but it sounds like you feel like that's fairly important to you and not something you necessarily want to do. But on the other hand, we've talked about ways in which that perhaps could be made a bit easier, but I'm not sure if you're ready to tackle that or pursue that right now. I'm just kind of wondering where you are.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
391,"So, um, it would perhaps be helpful if you could narrow it down to just one thing, and what would that be?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
392,"Okay. Well, one thing you could consider is talking to one of our social workers, they sort of specialize in helping people who have a lot on their plate identifying resources that they may need, uh, things you haven't thought of or aren't aware of. So, I don't know, would you be interested in doing something like that?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
393,"Okay. Great. Well, I can definitely set you up with that, and you can-",reducing alcohol consumption,1
394,"-um, try to tackle, um, your childcare issue, um, with some assistance. Is there anything else you'd like to do, um, for example, would you be interested in talking with me again, um, just as things progress?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
395,"Yeah. So, these are not problems that are going to go away in a week. It's going to take some time to resolve. Okay, great. So, um, it sounds like we have a couple of things, uh, to pursue.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
396,Would you be interested in perhaps thinking about setting a goal with respect to your drinking?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
397,Okay. Try to cut back a bit and see how that goes.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
398,"Okay. So, you can give it a go and, I think doing managing, you might just learn a little bit about how easy or difficult it's going to be, and-and also what it's like to cope with stress in other ways.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
399,"Okay, great. I look forward to talking next time.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
400,Mm-hmm. And there was a war going on?,smoking cessation ,1
401,"And the social stigma, because you don't want your daughter to think of you like that, whatever that- that as a smoker, you know. You know there're people who make the assumption and it- it sounds like those are more important to you than the medical things, and who cares why it's important?",smoking cessation ,1
402,It doesn't matter. So what- what ideas do you have about what might be most helpful for you in quitting smoking?,smoking cessation ,1
403,"So that was helpful for you that it's a, um, I can't remember. I know what you're trying to get a little ball.",smoking cessation ,1
404,"But it might be helpful if you- if you quit or it's, you know, it did if you were gonna decrease or whatever, to see how much better you're doing with the ball going up and your lung capacity increasing, is it?",smoking cessation ,1
405,"It's so interesting because there's immediate feedback. I mean, that's immediate feedback. Um, so we're- we're talking about quitting or here quitting completely. What thoughts do you have? You tried the Chan- the Chantix, meditation, you like that so, um, I can run some ideas that some other clients have used [crosstalk]-",smoking cessation ,1
406,"So, um, since you like meditation so much, it's highly likely that you'd be a great candidate for hypnotherapy.",smoking cessation ,1
407,"Yes, it is true. Yeah. It is. I mean, people don't come walking through the door who are not interested in it, you know? So, um, yeah, so that's-- So you'd be interested in something like that and, um, what- what other ideas have you thought about that would work for you?",smoking cessation ,1
408,Might become a better friend when you quit.,smoking cessation ,1
409,"Um, because I know you mentioned you tried the Chantix. Um, what have you tried? Uh, Zyban or Wellbutrin?",smoking cessation ,1
410,"It's the same thing. It's Wellbutrin, and when they found out by accident through what we call serendipity that you know what, Viagra. [laughs] That when- when people were on Wellbutrin that they tended to decrease and stop smoking, and, um, there were a couple of different reasons for that. Number one, people tend to get depressed when they quit smoking, because it puts you in such a state of deprivation and, um also-- well, so Wellbutrin really is a good antidepressant for them.",smoking cessation ,1
411,"The other thing is its a slight stimulatory effect and when people go off nicotine which is a stimulant the-they tend to get pretty tired overheard-- you know it's the opposite of however the nicotine makes them feel. And the Wellbutrin kind of with stimul-- you know stimulatory enough. [crosstalk] [unintelligible 00:05:56] And I-- the last I've read, and I've not kept real current about it, but I'm wondering about the-- what your thoughts are if any about the-- any of the nicotine replacements like the gum patch, the inhaler.",smoking cessation ,1
412,That strong spirit of you got instilled with her.,smoking cessation ,1
413,It is becoming a pain in the butt,smoking cessation ,1
414,I've never heard of Union break. I love it how you said. I love it.,smoking cessation ,1
415,"Union break. Yeah. le-leverage, and you know so it's something else you might know about nicotine is, um is that actually depending on how you smoke it, it can- it can be stimulant when you want it to be a stimulant if you smoke it in short, shallow puffs and then it can be a depressant like after a meal and you take longer inhalations, and it really tends to act on your central nervous system as a depressant. So it kind of does whatever you want at any given moment and yet there is this price that you pay",smoking cessation ,1
416,"Financially. Right, getting back to the finances and you know, you know, you know I'm thinking your daughter what a pain but it's become the finances the emphysema. I'm really-- because I would think that in 10 years, how much are you smoking now?",smoking cessation ,1
417,"Hey, hi, Andrea. Thanks for coming in today. So I don't know how much you've been told about why you're here, but basically, it's my job just to meet with all the students.

430,Okay. And how much do they typically drink?,reducing alcohol consumption,0
431,It has a lot of alcohol in it.,reducing alcohol consumption,0
432,"Okay. Um, so gosh, you're-you're actually really drinking quite a lot. Um, you know, your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-risk group.",reducing alcohol consumption,0
433,"Yeah. Um, so we call it high-risk because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you're gonna have some bad consequences from drinking like that. So, you know, things like, um, having car accidents, or other accidents, or getting in fights, or, you know, sexual assault, or health problems, or developing alcoholism. Have you thought about those things?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
434,"Okay. So it's, um, so it's good, because you're not drinking and driving, but you're still really drinking a lot. Um, and yeah. Okay. So, let's-let's talk a little bit about that, how you might be able to make some changes. Because I think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this.",reducing alcohol consumption,0
435,"So, um, do you think you could quit drinking or?",reducing alcohol consumption,0

442,"Um, so the way this normally works is, you know, we set you a goal, and then I'll have you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple of weeks and make sure that you actually stopped. Um, and so what do you think about that?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
443,"Okay. And then, um, you know, like, are your friends in band drinking?",reducing alcohol consumption,0

533,"Mm-hmm. So, do you think you can quit?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
534,"Okay. So, I'm going to write down then that you've decided to quit.",reducing alcohol consumption,0
535,"And, um, that's gonna be your goal, and that's great, you know, that's really why we're here, is to talk about that and-and make sure that you come to that decision. Um, so, I guess, can you quit this weekend then?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
536,"Okay, and then what about your friends who are still drinking?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
537,"Okay, and-and what if they won't?",reducing alcohol consumption,0
538,"Yeah. Probably if your friends won't quit drinking, you should just find new friends.",reducing alcohol consumption,0
539,"'Cause, you know, the problem is if they're drinking, they're gonna pressure you into drinking and then you're gonna feel awkward and, you know, you're gonna be stuck and-and not know what to do and really you'd just be better off probably without them.

542,"Okay, so, yeah, just another reason why you probably need to just quit then. Um, okay, yeah. I-- Okay, so, like I said, I'm gonna right down here that you've decided to quit and, um, uh, you know, I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably in the next semester sometime, so we can kinda check-in and-and make sure that, you know, that's still going well-",reducing alcohol consumption,0

615,And days that you know of on your less rigorous schedule that you're more likely to succeed [unintelligible 00:07:40] I really like how you're picking like three days a week instead of some days a week.,more exercise / increasing activity,1
616,Very clear you understand the whole idea of giving yourself a day off in between.,more exercise / increasing activity,1

623,"Okay. Yeah, no, all those things are good. I mean, I think you know, the will- picking a quit date has been found to be really effective. And, um, uh, I know you had talked earlier and then we'll end in just a couple minutes, but about, you know, like, the willingness or the readiness and most-- a lot of people, a lot of my clients have shared with me that when they woke up that morning, they truly had no idea that was going to be their last cigarette.",smoking cessation ,1
624,"No. Or- or some of them didn't have an exact date, but m-more importantly, was they-they just didn't know that was the day.",smoking cessation ,1

626,There's a smoke update coming up.,smoking cessation ,1

630,"And yet, on some level, you know, that it's gonna be a lot of hard work for you because of, you know, you've already known how anxious you get about a stash-",smoking cessation ,1
631,"So if you have a stash Nicorette gum if you decide to use it, I mean, you'd have to have other stashes, you know.",smoking cessation ,1
632,"Yeah. So, so if-if your doctor says it's okay with the Wellbutrin, one-- uh, we see very little if any weight gain-",smoking cessation ,1
633,"Yeah. And, um, the same with the Nicorette gum, because it- nicotine is an appetite suppressant.",smoking cessation ,1
634,"If you will. And that's if you decide you want to try a replacement therapy and that's what we call it and it-it kind of sounds from what you've described with your fear about you know, what it would be like of the withdrawal and everything like that. W-why you don't have to do it that way, you don't have to go cold-cold turkey.",smoking cessation ,1
635,"So, we'll do that so we'll-we'll talk about the hypnosis a little bit more, you know, you'll talk to your doc. Um, you'll do your research, you know, about programs and stuff, I'll give you any information I have and we'll take it from there. But it's sounding like the quit date might be coming up fairly-- like within the next two, three months.",smoking cessation ,1
636,"I, uh, mean that's up to you.",smoking cessation ,1
637,Yeah. Is it appealing the thought of quitting with a group at the same time?,smoking cessation ,1

650,"So you just- you just saw the doctor and, uh, you know, you sound like you just got blindsided, uh, with, uh, not only how, how frightening this seems that you have diabetes and that, uh, she-- you say she told you a whole lot of things that can happen with your eyes and circulation and all those kinds of things.",diabetes management,1
651,"And so you're really kind of reeling right now from, uh, all of that. And you sound a little bit pretty, pretty scared actually.",diabetes management,1
652,"So it sounds a lot like, uh, on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen, what worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control. Can't imagine doing all those things, so you almost feel like all that bad stuff's gonna happen.",diabetes management,1
653,"Okay. And I-- And what I want to do is help you kind of break this up into some-some doable chunks so that we can get your blood sugar down. I, you know, on the one hand, your doctor is right, you know. Your blood sugar is very high and we do wanna get it down so that we don't have those consequences happen. Uh, and-and there are a number of things that you need to do in order to-to get your blood sugar down. Um, you know, on the other hand, we can take this a step at a time, so it's not so overwhelming.",diabetes management,1
654,"Yeah. 'Cause it looks like you need to just take your medicine, uh, uh, once a day from-from the prescription. So that sounds doable right now.",diabetes management,1
655,"Okay. The other things that need to be worked on over time certainly would be changing your eating habits, you know, to eat- eat healthier, uh, not necessarily less, but healthier. And the other thing would be getting, um, some more physical activity. And by the way, that doesn't mean going to a gym. That means things like more walking, maybe using stairs instead of an elevator or an escalator, stuff like that. Uh.",diabetes management,1
656,Yeah. And that really is to give you feedback about how those other things are doing so that it keeps you on task.,diabetes management,1

Instead, I like to see if there's anything they would like to do, if anything, about their use. So what can you tell me about your marijuana use?",smoking cessation,1

663,"We know marijuana has effects on the developing brain. For example, it can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder for you to remember things, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs.

664,How do you think it affects you?,smoking cessation,1
665,How could you get in trouble at school?,smoking cessation,1

667,What would be the benefits of that?,smoking cessation,1
668,Marijuana affects how well you play. What would be the other benefits for you?,smoking cessation,1

670,How about this question? What might happen within a month that might make you want to vape?,smoking cessation,1
671,What else could you do instead of vaping when you feel that way?,smoking cessation,1
672,Playing basketball and playing video games are a way to feel better.,smoking cessation,1

I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going, different behaviors that you might be engaging in, and thinking about any changes you might wanna make for your life if you decide that you do.

691,And then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
692,"Not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you. Okay, that's great.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
693,"All right. Well, um, one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends. So what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
694,"Mm-hmm, and when you're hanging out with friends, is there ever alcohol involved?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
695,Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
696,"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And so when you go to parties, most of the time there's alcohol there?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
697,Okay. And how often do you think you would say you're drinking?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
698,Mm-hmm. So about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not. Can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
699,"So it really depends on what the activity is, whether or not alcohol is gonna be there?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
700,Okay. And do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus a night you're playing board games?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
701,Okay. So there's sort of pros and cons on both sides?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
702,Okay. What are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
703,"Okay. So sort of in the-the too much drinking or-or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
704,"You're trying to stay put, you're not driving. You're trying to stay with people that you trust. Um, but yet it sounds like there's still some-some things happening from time to time.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
705,Can you tell me a little bit about that?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
706,And how often do you think that happens?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
707,"-because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. And then, um, there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you, that sometimes you're stuck your-your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend who drunk too much. Okay. And the other not so good things about the alcohol?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
708,So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't need to see.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
709,"Got it. Okay. Um, all right. Well, you mentioned a couple of times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. Why did you make those decisions?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
710,"On the one hand, you- the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
711,"Right. And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
712,"Um, how do you think that the drinking fits in with that?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
713,Okay. So you're sort of looking for that balance-,reducing alcohol consumption,1
714,#NAME?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
715,Okay. And what have you come up with at this point? Do you have sort of a-a limit that you stick to or are you--?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
716,Mm-hmm. Okay. And do you feel that that's working pretty well for you or do you sometimes exceed that limit or-or what do you think?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
717,-would like to make some adjustments-,reducing alcohol consumption,1
718,#NAME?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
719,Uh-huh. So kind of combining you alls-,reducing alcohol consumption,1
720,"-goals. Okay. So, you-you have a goal it sounds like, of actually cutting back on your drinking. How important is it to you to work on that goal and on a scale of one to ten, where one is not at all important and ten is it's the most important thing right now?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
721,Uh-huh. Why do you say six or seven rather than like a four?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
722,"Yeah, looking ahead, you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
723,"Okay. Well, how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to-",reducing alcohol consumption,1
724,#NAME?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
725,"Oh, wow. Okay. Why do you say 10?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
726,"Okay. And so you mentioned the- you know, quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down. Um, have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
727,"So sort of, um, trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol-",reducing alcohol consumption,1
728,-and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
729,Okay. Does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
730,Does that sound like something you'd like to do?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
731,"Okay. Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself, really ambitious goals of going to medical school and, you know, becoming a psychiatrist or, um, some-some other form of physician. Um, you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
732,"And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a-a lot of friends who you feel probably would be, uh, supportive, even if you cut down on alcohol and that, you know, there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health, um, your school performance, and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of-of, um, drinking too much.",reducing alcohol consumption,1

746,"-as well as your teeth. So, we can see some recession that's gonna start to happen-",better oral health,0

754,"It hurts? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you having pain?",more exercise / increasing activity,1
755,"Well, you know, I-I understand that pain is hard to work through but a lot of time when you're having rehab after a stroke, that pain is telling you that your muscles and joints are starting to work again. So you can kind of think of it as a positive way to, you know, know that your-your body's getting back to normal.",more exercise / increasing activity,1
756,But what are your goals for the long term?,more exercise / increasing activity,1
757,"Oh, of course, of course. And what are the things that you'd like to be able to do once you get home?",more exercise / increasing activity,1
758,"Yeah, yeah. And so that's a very important goal to be able to get back home, to be able to get back to your independence. Have you thought about what it might take to get there?",more exercise / increasing activity,1
759,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're absolutely right. And it's also going to be very important that once you're home, you're able to continue on a regular activity program. Have you thought about what that might look like?",more exercise / increasing activity,1
760,"Not really, okay. Well, have you ever heard of something called Tai Chi? Is that a familiar term to you?",more exercise / increasing activity,1
761,"Well, you know, Tai Chi is one of the best ways to get your balance back after you've had something like a stroke. And it's also really good for preventing falls. And if you wanna be home and you wanna be doing the things you wanna do and going for walks with your dog, it's very important to make sure that you don't fall 'cause that would cause more problems down the road.",more exercise / increasing activity,1
762,So what do you think about Tai Chi? Is that something you think you might be able to try sometime?,more exercise / increasing activity,1
763,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's not that easy to get started. You do certainly have to have some motivation to want to do it. Um, and when you first start, oftentimes you do feel a little wobbly or a little insecure.",more exercise / increasing activity,1
764,"Yeah, yeah, I understand. So there are lots of places around that have it. Your local senior center would have it. And what I recommend is that you start by doing it in a chair. Just sitting in the chair.",more exercise / increasing activity,1
765,"You could. You can talk to the instructor and that way you won't fall, you'll feel confident and you'll start to learn some of the moves. And then gradually over time, as you get a little bit better at doing the moves in a chair, you can start to stand up, use the chair to lean on, and then eventually, you'll be able to get to the point where you can do it on your own.",more exercise / increasing activity,1
766,"You know, it cuts your risk of falls in half. It also helps to reduce pain although that's not a short-term benefit, you do have to stick with it for at least three to six months to start have it help reduce your pain. But it does have a number of things that I think would get you to your goals of being home and able to play with your dog and doing your own cooking and things like that.",more exercise / increasing activity,1
767,I do Tai Chi. I do it three days a week and it's really helped my balance as well.,more exercise / increasing activity,1

770,"Hi, I'm Bruce Berger. I work in the clinic and, uh, I noticed that you're in to pick up a prescription for Sarah's, uh, rescue inhaler-",asthma management,1
771,-for her asthma. I noticed that she's been in the emergency room five times in the last year for her asthma. What's that- what's that been like for you?,asthma management,1
772,"Okay. I-I also noticed that, uh, it's been about three months or so since you picked up the prescription for her chronic inhaler.",asthma management,1
773,Are you having some difficulties with that?,asthma management,1
774,"Well, it sounds like you care about Sarah a great deal. You-you don't want her, uh, using steroids. You're worried about what kind of effects those would have on her and you're- you're working hard to keep your smoking away from her so it doesn't affect her asthma.",asthma management,1
775,"Okay. Uh, would you mind if we talked a little bit about the chronic inhaler and the medicine that you're concerned about with, you know, the steroids because, you know, I certainly don't want her using a medicine that has steroids in it, like the ones that you're worried about for athletes. Uh, can we talk about that just a little bit?",asthma management,1
776,"If-if I can draw an analogy-- Again, even though this medicine is in the same family as those big broad-broad family. If I could draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are in the same family of fruits, you know, and obviously, grape is much smaller than a watermelon. And if you eat one grape, you'd be fine. If you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you very sick. If we look at the grape as the medicine your daughter's taking, again, it's in the same broad family, the amount of drug that your daughter is getting is very small. Uh, and not only that it's not an anabolic steroid, even though it's in the same big family. And what this drug does is actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And-and it doesn't even get absorbed into the body. It only goes to her lungs. And as I said, I wouldn't want your daughter taking a medication that could have the impact of those anabolic steroids. This is really safe for your daughter to use. So what-what are your thoughts about considering having her using this?",asthma management,1
777,"Yeah, def-definitely would not. I mean, probably you saw the name corticosteroid and thought, ""uh-oh.""",asthma management,1
778,"You know. And so-- yeah, and that- and that does concern people. But I do want to reassure you that this is medication that only goes to her lungs, and won't get in her body and they're not the same kind of drugs as the ones you're worried about.",asthma management,1
779,Do you mind if I talk to you a little bit about what your daughter's lungs are like when she's having these inflammations and needing to go to the emergency room?,asthma management,1
780,And so this chronic inhaler can really prevent that from happening. Okay? Which is why it's so important to use it.,asthma management,1
781,"The other thing I was going to tell you is that, unfortunately, uh, even though you are smoking outside and keeping the smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes, because her lungs are so sensitive, can also affect her lungs and cause her to have a reaction. Now, something I'd like you to think about is that, if you use the chronic inhaler every day, she may not be sensitive to the smoke on your clothes, but she still maybe because her lungs are just very different than ours. Um, honestly, I'd love to see you quit smoking for you too because, you know, as you know, it's not real good for you.",asthma management,1
782,"It-it-it-- Yeah. It may not- it may not when she uses the chronic inhaler, uh, but you'll need to keep an eye on that. Obviously, it would be- what would be best if it didn't get on your clothes, or you quit smoking.",asthma management,1
783,"Very hard. It's very relaxing, and-",asthma management,1
784,"Uh, again, if you get to the point sometime down the road where you're willing to quit for both you and her, uh, we'd be glad to help you do that. Because you're right it is- it's not an easy thing to do.",asthma management,1
785,"So it sounds like right now where we are, is you're willing to-to have her use the chronic inhaler-",asthma management,1
786,"-to try to get the inflammation down, so she doesn't need to go to the emergency room and do whatever you can at this point to keep the smoke off your clothes. And I think you're gonna see big changes in terms of, uh, her not needing to go to the emergency room, and you probably won't need to use the rescue inhaler hardly at all.",asthma management,1
787,"Yeah, because you'll get that inflammation down.",asthma management,1
788,Yeah. So we'll go ahead and get both of those prescriptions ready.,asthma management,1
789,"Use the chronic inhaler every day, keep the rescue inhaler around if she needs it. Uh, and let's see how that works.",asthma management,1
790,"Jean, it's good to see you again.",smoking cessation,1
791,"So, what's been different since the last time we talked a week ago?",smoking cessation,1
792,"So, you've been able to cut down by two or three cigarettes? That's amazing. I mean, given how much you were smoking.",smoking cessation,1
793,"So, you were able to keep the, uh, the journal?",smoking cessation,1
794,"You-- Sounds like you did that, and that allowed you to really focus on the time [unintelligible 00:00:57] delaying your cigarettes. So-so that's gone well. So, what are the things that are not going as well as you'd liked?",smoking cessation,1
795,"Okay. So, these automatic cigarettes, when you're socializing and you're-- you have time on your hands, really, are the problems that you're facing-",smoking cessation,1
796,"-uh, and that you've noticed are more difficult than the others?",smoking cessation,1
797,"Okay. So, from now to the next time you come back and see me, what is it that you'd like to-to work on?",smoking cessation,1
798,"Okay, so you can continue with that.",smoking cessation,1
799,You said five cigarettes this time.,smoking cessation,1
800,And any thoughts about what concretely you could do to make that happen?,smoking cessation,1
801,"So, given what you're-you're attempting to do, when would it be good for you to come back and talk about this?",smoking cessation,1
802,"Good. So, we'll see you in a week.",smoking cessation,1

814,Okay. So that gives you a good reason not to drink. Okay. Anything else?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
815,So you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink below risk levels?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
816,"Now let's look at your self-evaluation of your birth control. So now we're doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control.

818,Probably a six. Okay. So you're pretty confident that you can do it. And why are you a six and not a two or three?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
819,"Very good. So it looks like, um, you're using a good method of birth control, you're just not able to use it effectively. And you've linked it back here to the drinking. So would you like to develop a plan around your alcohol use at this-- today?",reducing alcohol consumption,1

830,Yeah. So they're really important to you?,taking medicine / following medical procedure,1

835,"Yeah. What do you think it'd be like for your kids if they were sitting here now and they heard you say that this was really, really important to you and to them? That you gave this program 100%. Well, then what might that be like for them to hear that?",taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
836,Good. Anybody else in your family that would be really proud of-- that you're taking these steps?,taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
837,Yeah. Your is mum still down south?,taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
838,Yeah. Does she know that you're here today?,taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
839,So how might it be for her if she knew that you're talking like this today? That-- 'Cause it sounds to me like you're really serious this time making some changes.,taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
840,So do you think doing this program and completing this program this time would be a good place to start?,taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
841,"Yeah. So you and I are going to be doing a little bit of work together then. And, um, and sometimes it-it can get quite tough. And I'm just wondering before we go any further, when the going gets tough, a lot of guys bail out. I'm just wondering are you one of those guys?",taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
842,"Good. One of the other things we're really conscious of with is, um, sometimes we do this work in isolation from others. And one of the things we want to ask people is about who they're going to be accountable to. I'm thinking like with your children, uh, your mom and other people that maybe you're interacting with. Who-who else in your life do you think would be supportive of you, and who would you need to let them know that you're actually going through this sort of program?",taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
843,What was-- what was your partner's name?,taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
844,Okay. What do you think it might be like for you to explore that with them?,taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
845,"Any other family members that, uh, live close that, uh, you think would be supportive?",taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
846,"Okay. The reason why I'm asking this, Rick, is just, um, you know, part of, um, uh, being responsible is turning up and doing the program.",taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
847,"The other aspect of that is kind of like who we're going to be accountable to while we're doing the program. So one of the- one of the challenges, one of the riddle I'm going to put in front of you is like who else can we get involved to support you while you're going through this?",taking medicine / following medical procedure,1
848,"Okay. So as we're gonna do this work together and go through this, uh, this program, one of the things we-we don't want to do is fall into the same trough we did last time. So I-I just want to leave that with you to think about next time we come together. There may be two or three other people that you think of that can be really supportive, that we-we need to let know that you're [unintelligible 00:10:50] each gonna make these changes and this time, you're serious about it. So let your mother and, uh, and, um, your partner, how might that happen? How does that sound to you?",taking medicine / following medical procedure,1

How would it be for your mum, do you think, if you were to tell her that this is something that you're-- is really important for you and that you know that this time you really need to do this for her and for the family?

933,"Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by?",smoking cessation,1
934,"Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing.",smoking cessation,1
935,"Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right?",smoking cessation,1
936,Okay. Is there anything I missed?,smoking cessation,1
937,So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette.,smoking cessation,1

939,Is there anything else that's not good about smoking for you?,smoking cessation,1
940,"So-so let me ask you this, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing to do, and 1 would be the least important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking?",smoking cessation,1
941,"Let me ask another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least confident, how confident are you that you will be able to quit?",smoking cessation,1
942,"Okay. Now, help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit.",smoking cessation,1
943,Okay. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to build that confidence to about 45%?,smoking cessation,1
944,"So if you got help, that would help you say that you went from 40% to 45%.",smoking cessation,1
945,"Okay. So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but as the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act. And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first small step. What are your thoughts about that?",smoking cessation,1
946,That's correct. And writing it down helps that process.,smoking cessation,1
947,"Okay. And I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to the next appointment, it could be something we could discuss. Okay. Anything else?",smoking cessation,1

I-I know that if you-you know, and if you want to keep Sarah out of the emergency room, uh, I-I just wish you'd heed what I'm saying. She needs to use that chronic inhaler every day to get her- to get her asthma under control, and the smoke on your clothes and the smoking flares her asthma up. So she really needs to use that chronic inhaler, and you really need to think about quitting smoking.",asthma management,0

961,Okay. So what about maybe sharing a little bit about your alcohol intake and maybe a little bit about what your- what your life's like a little bit for me today?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
962,"So it was kind of been a part of your culture a little bit, and you know, just find alcohol, maybe takes the edge off a little bit and-",reducing alcohol consumption,1

And that's if a woman isn't pregnant. And when it says in the guidelines, as far as drinking, uh, throughout pregnancy, there is no safe amount to drink during pregnancy. So really zero alcohol is, um, the woman should not be drinking any at all. And I'm just wondering what-what are your thoughts on that?",reducing alcohol consumption,1

974,"So you felt like, um, the information that you found supports the values that you have of being able to be independent and autonomous, to be able to make your own choice and the information that your doctor shared or spoke to you about, and then this brochure kind of feels like that's challenging sort of your values.",reducing alcohol consumption,1

Um, this is information that, uh, that I have been sharing with you earlier, this is the latest information evidence-based, um, on the latest research since 2011 and, um, a lot of research has gone into what is-what is okay for a mom to consume, like, alcohol.

990,"Well, you filled out this survey for us today, which was great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to review a couple of things on here. I noticed that you said that you drink two to three times a week, drink three or four drinks at a time when you do drink, and weekly, um, have more drinks than that. So six or more drinks, it says on here.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
991,"Okay, okay. I just wanted to let you know, I'm a little bit concerned about your level of drinking. We know that excessive drinking can make problems worse or can actually cause health problems at times, and I was just wondering if you thought about the connection between your drinking and things like the anxiety and the insomnia that you came in with today?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
992,"Well, you're not alone, a lot of people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you fall asleep faster, but it has what's called this rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up, may, might wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and have a hard time falling back asleep.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
993,"Mm-hmm. Well, I just wanted to just show you this little chart here. For your age as a male, you're drinking more than those at a low-risk level. Um, the low-risk level for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. And, in this case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. And you're right, you're not drinking as much as some people out there. The way you answered our questions here, you're actually falling in the high-risk category, the risky or hazardous category, category two.",reducing alcohol consumption,1

996,"Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, that's a good place to start. So, I heard you say your health is important, and you're getting ready to run a marathon, so you wanna be able to do what you can to make that successful. And you also were a little bit surprised that you fell into this risky or hazardous category.",reducing alcohol consumption,1

998,"Mm-hmm. So, what would that look like for you?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
999,"Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you were to look at this little form here and figure out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your goal?",reducing alcohol consumption,1

I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week.

So let me just show you on this, um, card here, um, from a medical perspective, we know that there's good evidence that shows that women you're age who drink more than, um, three drinks on any one occasion at any- at any sitting or more than seven in a week, are likely to run into health problems from their drinking, either problems they're having right now or maybe in the future.",reducing alcohol consumption,1

1006,"Mm-hmm. From this, uh, drinker's pyramid over on this side of the card, you can see that the-the score on your screening sheet shows that you're up in the harmful category of drinkers. So that it's likely you're drinking, you know, in quantities probably more than about 90% of the folks who come in to see me here at the clinic.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1007,"It doesn't feel like a problem to you right now, yeah.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1008,"Yeah, okay. And then the other thing I should mention, Jill, um, drinking more than these quantities, it's-it's possible it could be pushing your blood pressure up a bit, and I'm wondering if that might be affecting the difficulty we're having getting your blood pressure down right now.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1009,"My perspective as a doctor, it would be good if you could think about cutting back a little bit or doing something different about your drinking. What-what do you think about that?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1010,"Okay. So on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to do that and 10 being very ready, where would you lie on that scale?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1011,"Okay. Okay, so that sounds-- I think that's great. So why would you be up at a six and not down at a two level? What kinds of thing would push you to be there?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1012,Yeah. Yeah. So you've got some good reasons to try to cut back a little bit.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1013,Yeah. And it sounds like you're willing to maybe try not going to the bar quite as much and maybe drinking a little bit less when you go to the bar.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1014,Okay. So to what levels do you think you could do that? Where-where would you wanna go with your drinking?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1015,Mm-hmm. So you'd drink maybe just a couple of times a week and maybe a little bit less on each occasion? Is that what you're saying?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1016,And you think you're-you're able to cut down to those levels of no more than seven a week?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1017,"Okay. I think that sounds like a great step for you as your doctor. Why don't we revisit this the next time you come in to talk about your blood pressure in about six weeks or so and, um, then we can see how you're doing with it.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1018,"Well, let's get back to your blood pressure then and see what we need to do about that.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1019,And you've been talking about that a lot lately. So I really-,more exercise / increasing activity,0
1020,"-feel like this is something that you need to do soon because, um, a lot of times, you're just a lot of talk. And then, there's no action. And if you really wanna see results, I think it's something that needs to be done. And, you know, stop being lazy about it and just do it.",more exercise / increasing activity,0
1021,"All right. Well, um, I look forward to talking to you tomorrow. And I'm hoping that you're gonna be able to tell me that you went to the gym.",more exercise / increasing activity,0
1022,"Okay, so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aiden and that should help with the ear infection, but in looking through the chart, I mean, it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so.",smoking cessation,0
1023,"Well, now's the time to quit. It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. Not only for him, like I said, but also for you. You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease, for all kinds of things-",smoking cessation,0
1024,"There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit, this is really important.",smoking cessation,0
1025,"Okay. Well, I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's really putting yourself and your child in danger.",smoking cessation,0
1026,"Okay, hard part's over. So the good news is no cavities.",smoking cessation,1
1027,"Yeah, it is. It's some damage to the roof of your mouth that happens from tobacco smoking and so I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit how-- about how tobacco fits in your life right now.",smoking cessation,1
1028,"So you've made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, that's something you didn't want to do. It sounds like you're kinda concerned about the health effects of cigarettes. But you have been smoking the little cigarillos at least one or two every time you go out.",smoking cessation,1
1029,"Yeah, so you're not-- You're not like those chain smokers, you're not smoking packs and packs a day.",smoking cessation,1
1030,The amount you smoke is so miniscule you can't even imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your mouth.,smoking cessation,1
1031,"Uh-huh. So smoking has kind of become a big part of your social life now. When you go out, you're smoking, and even during breaks at work, you're smoking.",smoking cessation,1
1032,Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any not-so-good things about the smoking?,smoking cessation,1
1033,"Mm-hmm. So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful for you.",smoking cessation,1
1034,Mm-hmm. So it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of it is actually pretty bad for you.,smoking cessation,1
1035,"Well, the good news is in terms of the nicotinic stomatitis, at the point in which you stop smoking, you can actually reverse all the negative effects that occurred and you might also know that you can stop the progression of any other diseases that had started, just by quitting smoking.",smoking cessation,1
1036,Yeah. Is that something you'd be interested in?,smoking cessation,1
1037,"Mm-hmm. Well, if you think about it on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is really confident that you could quit if you tried, where do you think you fall?",smoking cessation,1
1038,"Okay, what made you choose seven or eight as opposed to a-a five?",smoking cessation,1
1039,"Mm-hmm. So, it sounds like just to kind of summarize, you've noticed some negative effects of the smoking, you have some concerns about health effects that could occur, there's the financial aspect, and yet you feel pretty confident that you could quit if you tried. So, where do you think we should go from here?",smoking cessation,1
1040,"Okay, well, I'd be happy to talk to you more about that and give you some tips and advice and give you some suggestions about where you can get some support with quitting.",smoking cessation,1
1041,I really appreciate you talking to me about this today.,smoking cessation,1
1042,"So, Chris, I wanted to talk to you. Um, you know, you're one of our star athletes. I really value you as a team player. As Athletic Director, one of my jobs is to, kind of, keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best. And something came up this weekend. I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1043,"So, here you are. You're an honors student. You're a star athlete. You've, kind of, been doing everything you've been told for all these years, and maybe last month sometime, you started getting more involved in the party scene.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1044,And it was fun at first. But now you're already noticing some consequences.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1045,It's really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1046,"Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though your mom got mad at you, you're having decreased focus, you're, kind of, not doing so well in school, maybe-",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1047,"Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying, it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1048,Your mom is really important to you.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1049,"How important is it to you to make, uh, an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1050,How confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or-or even cut down or quit?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1051,O-on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all 10 is completely what number would you give.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1052,Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1053,"All right, what do you think's a realistic goal for you then?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1054,"So your goal is kind of to do not drink at all or if you are at a party, uh, a maximum of one at the very most.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1055,"Yeah. Chris, I really appreciate you talking with me about this. I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is and, you know, like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you. So I'm glad we were able to talk about this. It really seems like you have a good plan going forward, you know, really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there's alcohol, making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum. It sounds like something that will work for you.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1056,"Thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes. I understand you don't have very much time, but I really appreciate you stopping by.",smoking cessation,1
1057,"Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things that-that you're also, uh, a bit concerned about, um, but as you said earlier, not-not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately.",smoking cessation,1
1058,"So Sandra, what's good about smoking? What do you like about it?",smoking cessation,1
1059,What else? Tell me what else is good about it.,smoking cessation,1
1060,Okay. So is there anything else that you like about it?,smoking cessation,1
1061,"So let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it, and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out.",smoking cessation,1
1062,"So it sounds like it's a way to relax. It's a way to socialize with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke.",smoking cessation,1
1063,"You also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight, and that smoking after meals is pleasurable, that it's something that would be really hard to give up.",smoking cessation,1
1064,"I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. It's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture, for you, some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking?",smoking cessation,1
1065,So I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things?,smoking cessation,1
1066,"And again, thanks for your honesty in talking about this. I appreciate that this is a- this is a tough topic. This is a-a hard behavior to think about giving up. Um, I guess one thing that- one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that, you know, on the one hand, you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority, it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter-",smoking cessation,1
1067,"-um, and on the other hand, I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief, socializing, and it's something you can't imagine ever changing. How do those two things fit together?",smoking cessation,1
1068,"So what would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important, that raised it up in the list of priorities for you?",smoking cessation,1
1069,"So, it's-it's not so much that you don't wanna quit in a way, it's almost, ""How could I do it that would work for me?""",smoking cessation,1
1070,Okay. I appreciate. We've- we've probably used up the time that we have. I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this. Is that something that would be helpful?,smoking cessation,1
1071,"[chuckles] Not necessarily the-the most exciting thing for you to do, but I appreciate you are willing to do that. Can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week? I promise it's not too time-consuming. Um, we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing, who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do, and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change, why you would even consider quitting smoking. And then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about, as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke. Is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days?",smoking cessation,1
1072,"So thanks for coming in, Sandra. We'll see you next week.",smoking cessation,1
1073,"In summary, the Minnesota State Mankato security report states that you were stopped on stadium road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence and you're transported to detox. Plus the report lists your age as 20. Dylan, what is the accuracy of the report? And can you share with me some details leading up to the incident?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1074,"You decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed at how the Vikings were playing. And when your roommate couldn't give you a ride home, you decided to drive yourself home. Did I get that right?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1075,"Yeah, I understand that your intention was to have a good time while watching the game with your friends. You didn't think about what could go wrong when you drank alcohol underage because you were at your friend's house and not a big party and you made an effort to be safe by finding a ride home.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1076,"Dylan, you told me what brought you here today, what do you think the problem really is?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1077,"Sounds like you attribute your current situation to bad luck. If that's what you believe and you don't attempt to make any change in your behavior, what consequences might result?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1078,Yeah. What would you be willing to do to prevent going to detox again and getting suspended?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1079,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you'll be able to follow through with that plan with 10 being very confident?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1080,What steps could you take to move that six to a seven or eight?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1081,College is all about making choices. Can you tell me about your beliefs and values that influenced your decision-making and how do those beliefs and values align with the decisions you plan to make about drinking?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1082,Thanks for coming in for participating today. Your sanction will involve being placed on university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar that will cost $150.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1083,"Okay, so why don't you have a rinse, David. How are you feeling?",smoking cessation,0
1084,"Good. Here, take a look, see what you think. And that feeling-",smoking cessation,0
1085,"-and the color's okay? You know, there is quite a lot of staining so, um, I'm just wondering about, um, some concerns about smoking.",smoking cessation,0
1086,"-coffee, tea. Yeah, you've heard this before, I'm sure.",smoking cessation,0
1087,"Mm-hmm. So, you know, the smoking is going to be related not just to some of the other negative consequences. You know, physically, it affects dental caries, dental cavities-",smoking cessation,0
1088,".No, it-- but David, it's not a waste. Research shows that people take on average about seven tries before they quit smoking, so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting, so--",smoking cessation,0
1089,"Well, I don't think I'm giving you a lecture, that's certainly not what I meant. I--",smoking cessation,0
1090,"Well, there's-there's a reason that [crosstalk] people are concerned.",smoking cessation,0
1091,The side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking.,smoking cessation,0
1092,"Like, that's the, I think, thing to really consider.",smoking cessation,0
1093,"Hello, nice to meet you again. And, uh, and what seems to be the-the problem or what-what prompted you to come along?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1094,Okay. Wh-What makes you say that it's gotten worse?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1095,"Okay, okay, so you've noticed over, I guess, uh, the last six months in particular since you decided, you know what? I'm going to take a risk and-a-and go out to try to meet a-a-a pot-potential partner again that it's with an increase in drinking.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1096,"Sure, sure. So you're noticing that the drinking at the moment is a way of perhaps calming the nerves?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1097,"That's interesting isn't it? You-- 'cause you kind of mentioned it there, like, you know, on one side of the coin, um, it helps calm the nerves to get yourself get out there and-",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1098,"-talk to guys at the same time, on the other side it's not working you're finding. And i-i-it results in hangovers or?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1099,"Okay, and so I guess, you know, what would you like to do given the circumstances?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1100,"Okay, okay, so, uh, sounds like you really want to stop drinking, particularly during the weekdays?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1101,"Right, because you're noticing it's having a negative impact on what you're eating.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1102,"No, I get it. Yeah. I mean, you know, it sounds like it's, it is helpful to a degree for you when you go out because it makes you feel a little bit more calm to talk to-to guys is that right?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1103,"Yeah, yeah. So, you've got, you know, some benefits there then, you know. The social element, hanging with friends and-and going out together is something which is-is quite enjoyable. So, it's not a case of removing it completely but it’s a case of, ""Okay, I’m noticing this is impacting on me more than what I’d like to."" Yeah. Yeah, okay.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1104,Has there been times in the past where you’ve tried to cut back on drinking?,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1105,"Oh, this is the first time anything like this has come up?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1106,"Okay, yeah. Well, it’s great that you’re able to identify, you know, what’s going on at the moment and you've-- not only know that, you almost picked up on a bit of a pattern too you're in-",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1107,"-as to why you’re-you're drinking. In terms of looking at cutting back on-on drinking, you know, on a scale of 0 to 100 and 100, uh, meaning it’s tremendously important for you and 0 not important at all. How important is it for you to cut back on the drinking?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1108,"Okay, yeah yeah sure, you're already taking a huge step forward in many ways by coming along to-to start talking about it.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1109,"Um, I guess 80 is quite high, what makes you say an 80 over say 50?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1110,"Okay, yes, so you’ve got this real sense of, ""I've gotta do something.""",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1111,"So, at the moment, it's been a case of the last six months, this is a pattern that you’ve been noticing more and more, um, a sign that it has had negative impacts on your lifestyle which you’re not happy with and you are in you're in a position where, you know what? I wanna do something about it.",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1112,"Okay, I mean what do you think that next step is?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1113,-so it just doesn’t go crazy.,reducing alcohol consumption,1
1114,"Okay, how does that sound like a first step goal for you?",reducing alcohol consumption,1
1115,I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-,diabetes management,1
1116,I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.,diabetes management,1
1117,"But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.",diabetes management,1
1118,And what did he have to say?,diabetes management,1
1119,"Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?",diabetes management,1
1120,"So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.",diabetes management,1
1121,"You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""",diabetes management,1
1122,Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?,diabetes management,1
1123,He's got a lot to do.,diabetes management,1
1124,So how are you feel in your head-,diabetes management,1
1125,"And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?",diabetes management,1
1126,"So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-",diabetes management,1
1127,#NAME?,diabetes management,1
1128,"-when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.",diabetes management,1
1129,"A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot",diabetes management,1
1130,Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?,diabetes management,1
1131,Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.,diabetes management,1
1132,"That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.",diabetes management,1
1133,Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.,diabetes management,1
1134,"Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.",diabetes management,1
1135,That makes a bit of sense.,diabetes management,1
1136,"Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.",diabetes management,1
1137,"And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.",diabetes management,1
1138,"So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.",diabetes management,1
1139,"You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.",diabetes management,1
1140,That's a good way to think.,diabetes management,1
1141,Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.,diabetes management,1
1142,"And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.",diabetes management,1
1143,"Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?",diabetes management,1
1144,Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.,diabetes management,1
1145,"Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.",diabetes management,1
1146,"From your perspective, things are going well?",diabetes management,1
1147,"Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.",diabetes management,1
1148,So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--,diabetes management,1
1149,And you know that's a bit too-,diabetes management,1
1150,"And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?",diabetes management,1
1151,"So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.",diabetes management,1
1152,Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?,diabetes management,1
1153,"And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.",diabetes management,1
1154,Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.,diabetes management,1
1155,"Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?",diabetes management,1
1156,So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-,diabetes management,1
1157,-when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?,diabetes management,1
1158,You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--,diabetes management,1
1159,You still run and have a cigarette?,diabetes management,1
1160,"Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.",diabetes management,1
1161,"But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?",diabetes management,1
1162,"Okay, so you meant to reduce.",diabetes management,1
1163,You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.,diabetes management,1
1164,"When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.",diabetes management,1
1165,So you've made our decision to do that?,diabetes management,1
1166,"Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?",diabetes management,1
1167,But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?,diabetes management,1
1168,"You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.",diabetes management,1

1171,"Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.",diabetes management,1
1172,And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.,diabetes management,1
1173,"So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-",diabetes management,1
1174,A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.,diabetes management,1
1175,Feel like you need to. Yeah.,diabetes management,1
1176,"The test, is the test, and experience, yeah.",diabetes management,1
1177,"I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.",diabetes management,1
1178,"It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.",diabetes management,1
1179,So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-,diabetes management,1
1180,"Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?",diabetes management,1
1181,"Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.",diabetes management,1
1182,"Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-",diabetes management,1
1183,#NAME?,diabetes management,1
1184,"So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-",diabetes management,1
1185,"Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.",diabetes management,1
1186,"You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.",diabetes management,1
1187,"So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.",diabetes management,1
1188,"So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.",diabetes management,1
1189,I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.,diabetes management,1
1190,"So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.",diabetes management,1
1191,"Not huge changes, but some little things you could do.",diabetes management,1
1192,"Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?",diabetes management,1
1193,Yeah? You like the social aspect?,diabetes management,1
1194,"No, no, I get that. I get that.",diabetes management,1
1195,"So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?",diabetes management,1
1196,And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.,diabetes management,1
1197,And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.,diabetes management,1
1198,That sounds like a great plan.,diabetes management,1
1199,"I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting a little bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit.",diabetes management,1
1200,"Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?",diabetes management,1
1201,What's to lose? What's to gain?,diabetes management,1
1202,"So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.",diabetes management,1
1203,"So you've got to work these things on your mind. You know, the-- And workout where's the place to start.",diabetes management,1
1204,"So it's been a bit of a-a bit of a shock, but now you kinda reflect on it.",diabetes management,1
1205,"-bit of a shake that I needed, you know, just sort of remind me. I might feel okay. I might-- From my perspective, your perspective, you're thinking, ""Well, what's the problem? Everything's fine.""",diabetes management,1

And-and we've also talked a bit about what's going to happen next. And you've come up with some great ideas. What I hear you saying is that, you know, before all this, before you met the GP, things are going fine.Well, as you would of-- As, you know, as you'd seen it, you were just doing your thing, and getting on working, and being busy, and being successful, and then suddenly this diagnosis, this doctor tells you that you've got a problem.",diabetes management,1

1235,"Okay. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really definitely white-colored and there's little red spots. And you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth, but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called nicotinic stomatitis. And this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes, are you smoking a pipe or cigars? Or is there something else that could be contributing to this? Because I don't know what else might be causing it.",smoking cessation,0
1236,"Okay, so I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, people think they're okay. Those are really bad for you. Did you know that?",smoking cessation,0
1237,"Right. They're still cigars and they're still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarette, so it's really important.",smoking cessation,0
1238,"What do you mean, maybe? I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth, you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit.",smoking cessation,0

1240,"Okay, well, that's a good start, but cutting back isn't going to do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from- from being at risk for these other diseases. But as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger.",smoking cessation,0

1251,"Yes. And honestly, I don't either. [chuckles] I just suspect that it might be slightly cheaper than some of the more private gyms.",more exercise / increasing activity,1
1252,So something to look into if you're interested.,more exercise / increasing activity,1
1253,And they-- I would suspect they'd be less sales pitch-oriented than a private gym. So it might be a safe place to explore first-,more exercise / increasing activity,1

1255,"That's great. It's important to know this about yourself, what works, and what doesn't work, and what you feel motivated to do. So, it sounds like we sort of have two small goals right now.

1259,Wonderful. Are there any other barriers that would be helpful to sort of talk through?,more exercise / increasing activity,1

If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. So check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. So if you use grapefruit juice every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication.",taking medicine / following medical procedure,0

1307,"What I would recommend is that you avoid over-the-counter cold remedies, keep him away from any friends or family who may have the flu, keep him well hydrated, um, avoid excessive dust, and avoid smoking. And at least that last one's easy because you are an ex-smoker now.",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,1
1308,"All right, Well, first I'd just like to commend you for your honesty and that's really helpful information that you shared with me. Thank you for letting me know that you're smoking again and-and, um, I also appreciate the fact you're taking so many measures to protect your son from secondhand smoke. Can I give you some advice on how you could protect him, even the- even further?",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,1
1309,"So, my sense is that you're smoking and you're minimizing hi-his exposure by not smoking in the same room and smoking near windows. Is that-",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,1

As a smoker, the ideal situation for a smoker in the house is if their home can be made smoke-free and the smoking is moved entirely outside, especially while he's experiencing this cold.",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,1
1311,"Okay, so, what I'm hearing you say is that, it sounds like a feasible short-term plan, not ideal and not comfortable because what you really enjoy is that cigarette with a glass of wine, kicking back up on the sofa and chilling out perhaps while you're watching TV. And to maintain that long-term outside smoking outside in Canadian winters where it's cold and snowy, not realistic.",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,1
1312,"So, on the one hand I'm hearing smoking and drinking at night as a way to chill out but at the same time the next day, you're not feeling so great.",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,1
1313,Would it be helpful to give you some information on low risk drinking guidelines?,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,1
1314,"Okay. Well, Hailey, what they suggest is that women don't have more than one to two standard drinks a day or a total of nine standard drinks in a week. How does that fit for you?",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,1
1315,"So, it sounds like you'd be open to reducing as a way to still enjoy the wine but perhaps alleviate the way you feel in the morning, some of the hangover effects that sounds like you're experiencing.",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,1
1316,"Okay. So, you're gonna try to reduce the drinking, not sure about the smoking, what the plan is but I think we did agree upon earlier that you would move it outside, at least while he's sick?",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,1
1317,"That's okay. All right and, um, I guess we'll see you next week for Jake's six-month checkup. Is there anything else we could talk about that might be helpful?",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,1
1318,"Sure, of course, Hailey a-and again I really appreciate your openness and honesty about letting me know what's going on with, you know, the stress levels and coping and drinking. I just had a thought that there's also a good mom's group, we run out of our center. So if you'd like a referral to that or some information, I'd be happy to give you and while you think about it, if you want to, um, talk about this further with one of my colleagues, I'd be happy to make you an appointment.",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,1
1319,"Thanks, Hailey. We'll see you next week.",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,1
1320,"No, wait a minute. That has everything to do with what we're talking about. I can't believe at the end of this appointment, you're just slipping in the fact that you've resumed smoking again. That's very, very important information for me to know. And I'd like to spend some time talking about it now.",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,0
1321,"Come on, Hailey. You're here because you thought he had pneumonia. You're telling me that Jake can't breathe, you're concerned about his breathing. And then you just slip in the fact that you're smoking cigarettes and you think there's no relationship? Do I really need to review all the risks of smoking in front of your-your child or exposing him to secondhand smoke not to mention the risks that you're posing to yourself and your own health?",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,0
1322,And let's talk some more about wine. You keep throwing wine into the conversation. It sounds like it's become a significant part of your daily routine. How much are you drinking?,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,0
1323,"I'm trying not to be hard on you, Hailey, but I've got to tell you as a position, it's a very big deal. Your drinking and your tobacco use are red flags for me and they need to stop immediately. So we've already talked about your plan for smoking. You're going home. You're throwing out your cigarettes. You're putting on the patches. What's the plan for the alcohol?",smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption,0
