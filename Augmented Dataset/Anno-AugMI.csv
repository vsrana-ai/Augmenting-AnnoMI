0,Thanks for filling it out. We give this form to everyone once a year regardless of why they come in. It helps us provide better care. Is it okay if I take a look at what you put down?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1,"So, let's see. It looks that you put-- You drink alcohol at least four times a week on average-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2,Okay. That's at least 12 drinks a week.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
3,"Uh, what else can you tell me about your drinking.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
4,"Okay. So, can I share with you some information on alcohol use?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
5,"Okay. So, there has been a lot of research on alcohol use and the guidelines we use in this country says that having seven or more drinks per week can raise the risk of health problems for women.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
6,"Yeah, you're surprised to hear that?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
7,"Well things like heart disease, cancer, liver problems, uh, stomach pains, insomnia. Unfortunately, uh, people who drink at a risky level are more likely to be diagnosed with depression and alcohol can make depression worse or harder to treat.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
8,Okay. And how do you feel after you drink?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
9,"So, there are some answers on this form here. Uh, less than monthly you drank more than you intended to.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
10,And sometimes you feel guilty after you drink.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
11,So you're not proud of finishing a bottle?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
12,Where do you wanna go from here? What do you wanna change about your drinking habits?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
13,"If I gave you a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to cut back on drinking and 10 being very ready, what number would you be at?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
14,Okay. Why do you think it's not something less like a six?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
15,What would help you cut back to two drinks?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
16,Having less wine in the house will help?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
17,What else besides drinking helps you relax and unwind in the evenings?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
18,"So, it's not just wine that helps you relax. Um, there's reading a book, watching a movie, and taking a hot bath too.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
19,"Okay. So, it sounds like you have some reasons to cut back on drinking and you have ways to relax besides drinking and it sounds like you're pretty ready to cut back.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
20,Great. I'd be interested to see how well you do on your goal in the next few weeks. Would you be willing to come back and talk to me about it?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
21,"Great. So, let's see how well you're doing with these new meds.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
22,"And before you leave, uh, is it okay if we go over this screening form that you filled out today on your alcohol use?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
23,"Okay. Uh, thanks for filling this out. Uh, looks like you use alcohol two to three days a week?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
24,"Okay. And then when you do drink alcohol, you typically have five or six drinks.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
25,"Okay. Well, the reason why I like to talk to patients when they fill out this form is because sometimes, uh, alcohol use can impact our health. Um, and my role is to be helpful. I can share some information with you about alcohol use, um, but I don't tell anyone what to do. It's always up to the patient to decide what they wanna do about their drinking. Um, so is it okay if we talk a little bit more about your alcohol use?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
26,How would you define drinking too much?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
27,So a limit of four a night doesn't feel right to you?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
28,"You're not alone in feeling that way. Uh, binge drinking can feel normal to some people.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
29,"Mm-hmm. Well, technically, we define binge drinking as having more than four drinks on one occasion.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
30,"Well, uh, we know if someone binge drinks over time, there's kind of two categories of risk. There's the short-term risk where someone who binge drinks is more likely to fall down, hurt themselves through an accident, uh, they're more likely to drive while under the influence. Uh, but over the long term, binge drinking can also, uh, cause things like heart disease, uh, different kinds of cancer, liver problems obviously, and then even mental health issues like depression and anxiety are more likely to happen.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
31,"Can I ask you, uh, what do you like about drinking alcohol?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
32,And so what about your drinking do you not like or is there anything that worries you about your drinking?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
33,"So, on one hand, you like how beer tastes, uh, it's part of your social life to some extent, um, but on the other hand, you don't like the idea of it posing risks to your health over the long term?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
34,"So weighing those things, you know, what you like about your drinking, what you don't like about your drinking, uh, where do you wanna go from here? Uh, what would you like to change about your drinking?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
35,"Well, how about hypothetically if I were to ask you, how would your drinking have to impact your life in order for you to be ready to change your drinking?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
36,"Okay, great. See you next time.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
37,"Hi, John. Nice to see you again. So, tell me, how are things going?",1,weight loss; diet
38,"Well, I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront. Do you mind if we explore this issue further?",1,weight loss; diet
39,"All right. Uh, well, it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently. And I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have it come back again. So, tell me what you did to lose that initial 5 pounds.",1,weight loss; diet
40,But you did have some success. Tell me how you felt when you lost the weight.,1,weight loss; diet
41,"Okay. Well, it sounds like you realized that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's gonna affect your overall health. So, tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back.",1,weight loss; diet
42,And how many servings of fruits and vegetables on average per day would you have?,1,weight loss; diet
43,"John, it's very important that you recognize that some fruits, but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories. Did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola?",1,weight loss; diet
44,"You're absolutely right, but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only. When it comes to nutrition, we have to have a more personalized approach. So I have a hunch, and that is the excess fruit that you were consuming probably caused your weight rebound. What's your impression?",1,weight loss; diet
45,"Indeed. Let me ask you something, knowing what you know now, how important is it to you to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking in?",1,weight loss; diet
46,"All right. So, you're not a zero. So, that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable, this is something you certainly can do it. Why are you not a zero?",1,weight loss; diet
47,"So, you realize, again, that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in, you're gonna decrease your weight, you're gonna feel better, and you're gonna impact your po- health positively?",1,weight loss; diet
48,"But you're also not a 10, and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success. What would it take for you to be a 10 or even an 8 or 9?",1,weight loss; diet
49,"Okay. Now, if the juice was still there, can you think of anything else you could do?",1,weight loss; diet
50,"Excellent. John, I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction. And the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in. So if I saw you in two weeks and I asked you how much juice you're t- drinking and how you did it, what would you tell me?",1,weight loss; diet
51,"Excellent. Well, it sounds like you have a plan. Same scale, 0 to 10, how confident are you that you can, uh, make this happen?",1,weight loss; diet
52,Excellent. I'll see you in two weeks.,1,weight loss; diet
53,"Okay, and so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel like your health is concerning you right now, or anything like that?",1,problem recognition
54,Okay. Okay. And how about going to see the doctor? Have you gone to-- for a visit or anything recently?,1,problem recognition
55,Okay. But you feel that you feel good?,1,problem recognition
56,"Okay. Um, and so what I hear is that you're-- you feel like your wife might be, uh, overreacting to this?",1,problem recognition
57,"Sure. Sure. Okay. Um, and so one thing I'd just like to do is maybe give you some information on, um, maybe obesity or diabetes if you're interested or open to that. If you're, you know--?",1,problem recognition
58,You got your lip pierced. How long ago did you get that done?,1,better oral health
59,What made you decide to get-get a lip piercing?,1,better oral health
60,"Um, I guess, you know, as your dentist, I have- I have a couple of concerns about lip piercings, oral piercings. I wonder what have you heard about how having an oral piercing can affect your-your teeth or your gums?",1,better oral health
61,You do. you have beautiful teeth as I always tell you-,1,better oral health
62,"Um, I mean I have had some patients with oral piercings and they can erode some of the gum right, um, just right there at the front.",1,better oral health
63,"Um, so that's one-one thing, and the other is, um, I do see fair amount of chipped teeth-",1,better oral health
64,"Yeah. There's certainly been-- There's no problems and you, as you said, only have had it for a short time.",1,better oral health
65,"Um, what would- what would make you decide, ""This is something that's not right for me?""",1,better oral health
66,"Yeah, it looks nice. So, you want to monitor it and-and-",1,better oral health
67,"Emily, you said it so well it-",1,better oral health
68,"-the-the piercing might not last forever, but your teeth really are-",1,better oral health
69,"-hopefully forever. So, okay, well thanks for-for talking about it-",1,better oral health
70,"-with me, and also before I do the exam, you know, I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we can take [inaudible 00:02:46]-",1,better oral health
71,"Hi, another session and another session where you are actually on time.",1,reducing recidivism
72,"You've done-- You've got a really good track record of, uh, being on time. Yeah? Do you realize that?",1,reducing recidivism
73,"Yeah. Yeah. You know, I've been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you've made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we've been meeting?",1,reducing recidivism
74,"Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with?",1,reducing recidivism
75,"Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy?",1,reducing recidivism
76,"Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that's a pretty big deal.",1,reducing recidivism
77,"Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I'm wondering if the Billy of six months ago would've done that?",1,reducing recidivism
78,"Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What's shifted in you?",1,reducing recidivism
79,"Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time.",1,reducing recidivism
80,"Okay. So, what did you say to Donna?",1,reducing recidivism
81,"Okay. So, where did you get to in terms of telling her that, uh, reading and writing is not that [unintelligible 00:27:23] for you?",1,reducing recidivism
82,"So, I was thinking about how that stuff about not feeling confident around reading and writing has, um, really got in the way for you.",1,reducing recidivism
83,"And I mentioned that's somewhere where you don't feel so confident, and I'm wondering what it would be like to feel confident with reading and writing. What difference would that make to your life?",1,reducing recidivism
84,"Yeah. Yeah, I can really see that you're making an effort. In fact, I can see that you're really making an effort in lots of areas, not just in terms of reading and writing.",1,reducing recidivism
85,"So, where are the forms now?",1,reducing recidivism
86,"So, what needs to happen next?",1,reducing recidivism
87,"So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you?",1,reducing recidivism
88,"Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you're gonna do that?",1,reducing recidivism
89,"Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech?",1,reducing recidivism
90,And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there?,1,reducing recidivism
91,"Mm-hmm. So what's the- what's the-- Say, if you get on the course-",1,reducing recidivism
92,"-and, um, you're, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don't feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that?",1,reducing recidivism
93,"So, all these changes that you've- that you've made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now?",1,reducing recidivism
94,"So, offending gets in the way of the life that you're starting to lead?",1,reducing recidivism
95,"Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending?",1,reducing recidivism
96,"So you've noticed that when you've been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or?",1,reducing recidivism
97,It's harder to think straight when you've been drinking?,1,reducing recidivism
98,Yeah. Yeah. And so you've got Donna around at the moment?,1,reducing recidivism
99,"And that's helping keep you in check, as you said?",1,reducing recidivism
100,Yeah. What would happen if she wasn't around say or at a party or?,1,reducing recidivism
101,Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength?,1,reducing recidivism
102,Mm. Yeah. 'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you've got about the job and a life with Donna and-,1,reducing recidivism
103,-kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn't fit in with that dream or that idea.,1,reducing recidivism
104,"So there's that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there's the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you've had a few to drink and you're with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh?",1,reducing recidivism
105,So you've got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah?,1,reducing recidivism
106,"And it sounds like sometimes when you're in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it's hard to hold on to that vision of the future.",1,reducing recidivism
107,"Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking?",1,reducing recidivism
108,Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next-,1,reducing recidivism
109,Mm-hmm. So it's hard to actually say no to your friends-,1,reducing recidivism
110,-'cause of what they- what they thought of you.,1,reducing recidivism
111,"Yeah. So I'm wondering what the-the thinking, 'cause, um, one of the things that's really changed for you is being with Donna.",1,reducing recidivism
112,"So I'm wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys.",1,reducing recidivism
113,Yeah. And you're saying you're kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you're spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past?,1,reducing recidivism
114,Okay. So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it.,1,reducing recidivism
115,But we're also talking about this idea that it doesn't fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are?,1,reducing recidivism
116,Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be?,1,reducing recidivism
117,"Mm, well the stuff about when you're in the moment. Yeah.",1,reducing recidivism
118,When you've had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble. How would you like that to be different?,1,reducing recidivism
119,"Okay. So-so Donna's helped calm you down and you'd like, um, them to calm down too?",1,reducing recidivism
120,So am I hearing that it's tricky in some ways to hang out with them sometimes-,1,reducing recidivism
121,"Okay. So-so what's the definition, for you, of a good mate?",1,reducing recidivism
122,"So, someone who's loyal, someone who's got your back, yeah? What else? What else is really your definition of a really good mate?",1,reducing recidivism
123,"Oh, so, someone who'll stand up for you?",1,reducing recidivism
124,"-for you? So, I'm wondering about, um, whether good mates lead you into trouble, if it's something you wanna do. If you got something different that you wanna do, what would a good mate do in that situation?",1,reducing recidivism
125,"Yeah. How-how would you wanna be supported, Billy?",1,reducing recidivism
126,"Mm. Okay, so that's-that's the kind of support that a really good mate would give you? It sounds-",1,reducing recidivism
127,-like these guys have been around for you-,1,reducing recidivism
128,"-for quite some time, and they're really important to you.",1,reducing recidivism
129,"Yeah. Okay. So, I'm wondering how we can get to that point where, yeah, you can say, ""No, I don't wanna do that,"" and they're supportive of you?",1,reducing recidivism
130,"Okay. So, how would they know you're serious?",1,reducing recidivism
131,Okay. That's the second time you've used that word 'guilty'.,1,reducing recidivism
132,"Yeah? So, it sounds like it's a really-- something's really important to you about that.",1,reducing recidivism
133,"Okay. So, it's almost as if you feel a bit torn because you wanna be with Donna, but you also wanna be with your-",1,reducing recidivism
134,"Yeah, so they're still important to you?",1,reducing recidivism
135,Hmm. I also am hearing that you don't wanna get into trouble anymore.,1,reducing recidivism
136,"Hi, Sal. Thanks for coming in today.",1,asthma management
137,"I saw that your doctor made the referral and, um, and I really appreciate you taking the time to come and make that appointment.",1,asthma management
138,So you made it in here-,1,asthma management
139,- and do you have a sense of-of what some of the doctor's concerns were that led her to refer you?,1,asthma management
140,"So your asthma has been acting up and there's a lot of stuff, not just the asthma going on?",1,asthma management
141,"Well, we have about, I guess, 15 or 20 minutes together and I wonder, would it be okay, if we took a couple of minutes and just kind of looked at all of the different things that are going on for you and maybe you can let me know, what would be the most helpful to spend-spend some time on?",1,asthma management
142,"Okay. Well, one of the things that-that we use are these-- it's kind of like a worksheet and it's an agenda-setting worksheet basically.",1,asthma management
143,"It really-- You're in the driver's seat, so it's just to kind of put all the cards on the table, so to speak.",1,asthma management
144,"So your dog, and-and the doctor's saying the dog's—",1,asthma management
145,That's pretty shocking to be told that you have to get rid of your dog.,1,asthma management
146,Hmm. So that's a huge stress right now?,1,asthma management
147,"Okay, so smoking and-and I'm working towards quitting completely sounds like that's a goal for you?",1,asthma management
148,"Right. Right, right. So the appointments and time.",1,asthma management
149,"Right. Well, so where would you-- I mean, if you-you had to pick somewhere, one or two kind of high priorities or-or things to talk about in our time this morning, where would you wanna start?",1,asthma management
150,"Okay, and those are ones that are pretty related to each other-",1,asthma management
151,So I know we've determined that you sprained your ankle yesterday and I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit about how that happened?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
152,"No, I guess that that would be the end of your, uh, shaking and moving. I know-- I wonder if you'd be open to exploring your alcohol use and what that looks like during the week.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
153,You're still feeling the effects of-,1,reducing alcohol consumption
154,So what is a typical week for you as far as your alcohol use?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
155,So a few drinks is nothing new to you?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
156,And what does a few drinks look like? Is that per night? Is it two drinks?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
157,All right. Do you have any concerns at all about your alcohol use?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
158,Would you be open to kind of looking at the low-risk drinking alcohol guidelines?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
159,"-and what the safe limits are for women is 10 drinks for women a week with about two drinks, uh, per day.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
160,Where do you- where do you feel you fall into that?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
161,"Okay, so it's kind of a way to cope through stress?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
162,"Right, and is that something that has been, you know, a way of coping for a while?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
163,Okay. Does that concern you at all?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
164,Do you feel like you have any reasons to kind of bring your alcohol use down within the limits?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
165,"I'd love to, uh, set up an appointment for you if you can come in later this week or early next week to-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
166,#NAME?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
167,"So, what brings you here, Bob? What's, what can I do to help?",1,smoking cessation 
168,"So, let me ask you this, Bob, what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking?",1,smoking cessation 
169,"Wow, that she's been showing you and making you read.",1,smoking cessation 
170,"So, you're pretty angry about it. It's pretty outraging that you're forced to change your whole life because of a decision she made six months ago.",1,smoking cessation 
171,"So, from your perspective, do you see any consequences to your smoking?",1,smoking cessation 
172,"So, let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario 'cause there's a lot of pieces to it. Your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too. So, you're sort of isolated, you're put in a corner and you're being told this is something you have to do, you have no choice in the matter.",1,smoking cessation 
173,"You have a few concerns about your health, but that's not really the driving force. It sounds like it's most of all that it would be nice if things just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore. Does that pretty much sum up--?",1,smoking cessation 
174,I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you. That you would do anything.,1,smoking cessation 
175,"So, it strikes me that the way that we're talking about it, it's like it's all or nothing. Either you keep smoking the way you are, things continue to go downhill and get worse, your wife gets more and more on your case, or you put your cigarettes down starting the moment you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again. It's almost like one or the other. It strikes me that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking.",1,smoking cessation 
176,There are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt. Recognizing that it-it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be.,1,smoking cessation 
177,"If you wanted to bring your wife along, I'd be more than happy to talk with both of you.",1,smoking cessation 
178,"So now that we've discussed a little bit of your medical history and- and taking your vitals, I'd like to ask you a few more questions. The-",0,reducing alcohol consumption
179,"-the rise in your blood pressure is concerning to me, so I'd like to gather a bit more information about your lifestyle.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
180,Okay. Have you had any major stressful events recently or any change in your work situation?,0,reducing alcohol consumption
181,"Yeah, that's certainly true. I'd also like to ask about some health habits that can contribute to high blood pressure.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
182,"Okay, do you smoke at all?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
183,"Okay, great. Um, do you drink alcohol, including beer or wine?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
184,"Okay. Well, I'm concerned about the amount that you're drinking currently. It sounds like you're having about 15 to 20 drinks per week, and that's definitely more than what we would recommend and could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
185,"Well, according to your chart, your blood pressure has gone up since July, and you said that you've been drinking more recently, so do you see the connection there?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
186,"Alcohol can have some dangerous effects on your body. So along with contributing to high blood pressure, it can have a big impact on your liver, which you need to keep in mind. So your liver has several different roles in your body. First, it helps process excess fatty acids before they get distributed to the rest of your body. It also helps process alcohol and other drugs. So when you have an excess of alcohol, your liver can't work as efficiently and the fatty acids build up, and over time, your liver won't be able to work as well.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
187,"Okay. And how about the use of other drugs like cocaine, heroin, marijuana?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
188,"Okay. And then we'll set up an appointment for about a month from now. We'll recheck your blood pressure and see how you're doing with all this, sound okay?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
189,"Okay. Um, what brings you in?",0,diabetes management
190,Mm-hmm. I see- I see that your A1C or your blood glucose is very high.,0,diabetes management
191,"Mm-hmm. Well, you do need to take your medicine. We, uh, will need to start dieting, uh, you know, lose some weight, change-change your eating habits, exercise, uh, to get your diabetes under control, because your doctor is right, it is very serious.",0,diabetes management
192,"So, uh, you know, we-we need to start looking at doing all those different things to get your diabetes under control 'cause your-your number is very high.",0,diabetes management
193,Just enough for your own use?,1,reducing recidivism
194,"Yeah, we-- You know, we have about 15 to 20 minutes to talk today, total. Um-um, which certainly it's just the first of-of some sessions that we'll have together over the next six months. It'd be a natural question you'd wanna know how much time this will take, of course. Um, what else would you like me to know about you and your perspective that you think will help me work with you over this time?",1,reducing recidivism
195,Okay. You're more focused on what you need to do to get this behind you?,1,reducing recidivism
196,Okay. So about how much are you smoking over the course of a day? You had said it had increased over once or twice a day.,1,smoking cessation 
197,"Okay. So about eight cigarettes. So over the course of a day, just under half a pack?",1,smoking cessation 
198,Okay. And that's changed over what period of time?,1,smoking cessation 
199,"Okay. So over the past year, the smoking has increased. And that's been mainly in the evening?",1,smoking cessation 
200,"Mm-hmm. Well, that's the time when you can relax and unwind.",1,smoking cessation 
201,"Yeah, exactly. You know, I told you, my-my schedule is kinda crazy right now. I, um, I work full-time and I just started back at night classes. So, you know, all that combined, you know, I enjoy that time to myself in the evening.",1,smoking cessation 
202,"Sure. Sure. Well, it's a time to relax and you've got a lot going on.",1,smoking cessation 
203,So are there other things you do in the evening to relax?,1,smoking cessation 
204,Okay. A drink or two. So about how many drinks would you say you have over the course of a day?,1,smoking cessation 
205,Two max. How many drinks would you say you'd have over the course of a week?,1,smoking cessation 
206,"No, I understand- I understand. And I'm certainly not here to tell you what to-to do, Sarah. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and sharing some information with you, and what you do with that information is totally up to you. You've got a lot going on. You're a mother, you're working, you're going to school, and our healthcare team wants to make sure that you have all the resources available to you to meet your goals, including good health. And my job as your healthcare provider is to listen to you and to share information with you, including healthcare concerns associated with smoking and alcohol. Would that be okay with you?",1,smoking cessation 
207,#NAME?,1,smoking cessation 
208,So you're consciously trying to cut back.,1,smoking cessation 
209,About a five. So you're halfway there. So why did you choose a five rather than a four?,1,smoking cessation 
210,"Okay. So you-- that's cutting back quite a bit. That's a big step. So since we're kind of running out of time here today, I'm wondering if we could-- would be willing to come back in about four weeks to review this plan?",1,smoking cessation 
211,"Okay. Well, I've got a brochure here and this has-- it's a really good brochure. It has some distraction techniques in it in case you get those nicotine cravings. So it's-",1,smoking cessation 
212,"-been helpful, um, in-- with patients before. I'd also like to ask you, would you be willing to see one of our counselors?",1,smoking cessation 
213,"Well, Dr. Kirtley is one of our counselors and he is an expert in-- at discussing the association between alcohol and stress. I want to share something with you. The National Guidelines recommend that women have no more than seven drinks of alcohol per week to-to stay at that low risk level, to avoid the healthcare concerns that we spoke of earlier.",1,smoking cessation 
214,"You've indicated that your alcohol consumption is a bit higher than that, putting you at risk. So that's why I asked if you'd be willing to talk to Dr. Kirtley.",1,smoking cessation 
215,"Hi, Mrs. Smith. I wanted to let you know that at this appointment, we're gonna be giving Lilly some vaccines.",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
216,Hmm. Can you tell me more about your concerns about vaccines?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
217,"Okay, so you were thinking that maybe exposing Lily naturally to these diseases would be a better choice than using vaccines to help her get stronger?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
218,"That's right. Having chickenpox as a child means that you are less likely to have chickenpox as an adult because you've developed a-a natural immunity. Uh, but is it okay if I offer you a little bit more information about the other vaccines that we're- we were going to give her Lily today?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
219,"Okay. So, uh, before vaccines were developed, often when children had a natural exposure to some of these diseases, they ended up with, uh, sometimes death, disability, measles caused brain damage and, uh, deafness and blindness. Polio caused, uh, paralysis in children. And so, allowing children to have natural exposure to these diseases, sometimes was a little bit of a gamble, it could be dangerous.",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
220,It's really important for you to make sure that she's protected and that you make good decisions and do your research before you make any medical decisions for her.,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
221,"So, again, I hear your overall goal is really, to not give up these things you'd like but to cut back on how much you have-",1,weight loss
222,"-on that. All right. So, I'd like to ask you, uh, kind of a scaling question about this 'cause I'm hearing that this feels really important to you that you'd be way up there on the high- on the high end of importance.",1,weight loss
223,"So, I'm gonna ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident, and 10 is like, ""I'm very, very confident,"" where would you put yourself on a scale right now of confidence in starting this new plan?",1,weight loss
224,"Okay. All right. So, let's talk about that, um, so we should just assume we're gonna be at a four.",1,weight loss
225,"So, why are you at a four and not even a lower number? Why are you not like a zero or a one?",1,weight loss
226,"Okay. So, what would help increase that confidence? What-- Because that sounds like where we really need to focus on. What's gonna help you feel more confident about this?",1,weight loss
227,"All right. Well, if it's okay, just for a moment, let's put the- let's put the changing the eating pattern off to the side, and let's take a look at some other time in your life that there was something you really wanted to accomplish and you did. And what is it about you- what was it about you? What kind of strengths did you bring to the table that allowed you to tackle something that felt like a challenge and-and allowed you to be successful?",1,weight loss
228,"We don't really recommend that. The idea is you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit, so then you wouldn't be smoking at work, but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either.",0,smoking cessation 
229,"Well, to be honest with you, you mentioned the patch. I can't recommend a patch to you if you're gonna continue smoking. That can actually be pretty dangerous for you. In order to advise you about this at all, I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now.",0,smoking cessation 
230,"Well, there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings, and probably the gum would be the best option for you. It's not something you would continue to use continuously throughout the day, however, but gum is something you use just when you have a craving.",0,smoking cessation 
231,"Well, aside from the gum, you could try the nicotine lozenge, that would be another option for you. Again, that's not something you'd wanna use continuously throughout the day. The nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement, but again, that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke.",0,smoking cessation 
232,"So, Rick, just in regards to your flatmate situation at the moment with Tristan. Uh, you know, we talked about how walking through this program and with the support of your parents and having some positive influence to help you through this. I just want to rethink a bit if you stay living with Tristan. What are the sort of pros and cons of that? What are the good things about living there, what are the not-so-good things about living there?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
233,"Yeah. So, in terms of being supportive and a sort of support you're gonna need to make these changes.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
234,"Okay. What are some of the pros and cons about moving in with whāna, moving in with your auntie and uncle?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
235,"In terms of that freedom and in charge of yourself, and the changes that we're talking about, and building your own family, and to enable you to do that, where do some of that freedom stuff sit with re-engaging back with your whānau and your children, your partner? Is it something you're gonna wanna hang on to, or how you're going to manage that?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
236,"Okay, so I'm just gonna ask you a couple of more background questions.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
237,Okay. How about in the last year?,0,reducing alcohol consumption
238,"Okay. So it sounds like you're drinking about four times a week, anywhere between three and eight drinks on a given day. So, maybe around 20 drinks a week?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
239,"Do you, um, do you ever use any prescription medicines that were not prescribed for you, or ever use your own prescriptions in a way on which they were not prescribed?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
240,"Okay. So, you know, as we said before, you're drinking-- it sounds like you're drinking about 20 drinks a week, over the course of a few days. And I did want to point out to you that the recommended limit for women is actually no more than seven drinks a week, and no more than three on a given day.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
241,"So you're doing more than that right now. And when you drink more than this amount, it puts you at risk for a number of things, okay? Things like greater risk of injury, damage to different parts of your body, um, just a bunch of different problems. And, uh-- so I'm going to recommend that you cut down- cut down that amount to the recommended limit. Again, that's no more than seven drinks a week and no more than three on a given day. Do you think you could do that? Would that be a good goal for you?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
242,"Yeah. Well, it's possible you strained your ankle as a result of the alcohol. You know, it can actually affect your balance and stability. So, really, you know, for where you are right now, you're drinking a good amount more than what's recommended. And, you know, I want you to be healthy. And I don't want to see you coming back in here for something else. So I'm really gonna recommend that you try to cut down to that amount. So, do you think you could do that, cut down to no more than three drinks on a given day?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
243,"So, it sounds like, you know, the amount you drink is pretty normal-",0,reducing alcohol consumption
244,"-amongst the people you typically drink with. But these limits are-- they're actually recommended for all adults. And studies have shown that when you drink more than this, it creates a bunch of problems like we talked about. So, you know, why do you think you drink the amount you drink?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
245,"Well, I think you can still have fun within these amounts. So that's what I'm gonna recommend. Um, I think this is a really good goal, and hopefully, we won't see any more injuries. Okay? So why don't you try that?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
246,All right. Thank you so much.,0,reducing alcohol consumption
247,"So I get a sense it's a little anxious being here today and, uh, meeting someone like me, and, um, what we're gonna be doing today is-is inducting, but also I wanna talk about, um, yeah, the issues that-that have got you here and we need to do some sorting out around, um, yeah how serious you are to sort of sort those issues. So?",1,reducing gambling
248,"So first, it might be trying to sort out what are the important issues to sort out.",1,reducing gambling
249,"Yeah, that makes sense? Yeah? So how confident are you that-that, you know, you can sort out the issues related to, um, you know, uh, taking the money from your employer? And another thing, in your precinct's report, there were some issues around gambling, and some issues around alcohol use. So those seem to be important issues that are kind of getting out. So how confident are you that you can get those sorted in the nine months we've got?",1,reducing gambling
250,"Yeah. See one of the things I'll be really interested in-in talking with you about is, um, yeah, what's-what's the, um, what's the worst thing that has happened in terms of pokies, in terms of you know behavior around the pokies, what's the worst thing that's happened?",1,reducing gambling
251,Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket,1,reducing gambling
252,"Yeah, yeah. So if we were to think back, say the last month, the last four weeks, how many times would you have gone down to the- to the pokies, the pub?",1,reducing gambling
253,That-that you're up for the money and-and then-then they slot you.,1,reducing gambling
254,"Okay. So-so thinking about this, say a couple times a week, you know, two or three?",1,reducing gambling
255,"Yeah, yeah, yeah? So that's 12 times. So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense?",1,reducing gambling
256,Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50?,1,reducing gambling
257,"'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's [crosstalk]",1,reducing gambling
258,"And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um—",1,reducing gambling
259,"A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so.",1,reducing gambling
260,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that could be an issue we could spend some time talking about here, 'cause obviously you know, you don't- you don't - you don't wanna be here, and then my interest now is just getting you o-out of the system, not getting you into the systems. So-so here, um-- how-how much do you think this is an issue for you, you reckon? The pokies and the gambling.",1,reducing gambling
261,"Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff.",1,reducing gambling
262,"Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you?",1,reducing gambling
263,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, in terms of the pokies and stuff they much as they like doing the pokies so much as your doing the-- You know, compared to you doing the pokies?",1,reducing gambling
264,"Oh, okay, okay. Who's-who's-- What's your girlfriend's name, your best- your best friend, best girl friend?",1,reducing gambling
265,"Sarah, So what do you think Sarah would say?",1,reducing gambling
266,"Yeah, what would she say about-- 'cause she knows you pretty well. She'll-she'll-- she goes to the pubs with you probably and see you putting the money on pokies, what would she reckon?",1,reducing gambling
267,"Absolutely, and that's what you want from friends, isn't it?",1,reducing gambling
268,"You want that acceptance, absolutely, yeah, yeah. But won't you say, you know, friends also-- good friends also can, you know, call you on stuff too, can't they? Yeah?",1,reducing gambling
269,"At times. Yeah, so-so what you-- wha-what she might say to us about about- a-a-about your gambling?",1,reducing gambling
270,"Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So Sarah might see it as an issue. And-and I guess there's a part of you also sees it as an issue, part of you, you know. Part of you may not, but a part of you does.",1,reducing gambling
271,"So the part of you that does see this is-- as an issue, yeah, that the gambling sometimes can be out of control, you know, tell me that part of you that-that maybe knows that, uh, it's getting you into trouble and it's gone way-- just moved you off from that point, there have been some—",1,reducing gambling
272,"Yeah, and-and in some ways getting caught might be a good thing. I know it might sound a re-really sort of strange thing to say, but I wonder if like getting caught might have been a good thing. Because you would have read the papers about other people's of-- you know. They're the hands that would turn on stuff and end up with gambling problems and big money. So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you. What's your hunch about that?",1,reducing gambling
273,"Yeah. Yeah, so you're not a bad person. Certainly, I don't make judgments about people being bad people. So that seems sort of actually thinking about this, you sensed that you could've stopped.",1,reducing gambling
274,"Have you put on a kind of real hat, you know, you get a real hat here, you know? What-what's your hunch about that? Is it a kind of-- that kind of realization it's a bit of a smoke screen, what's your hunch?",1,reducing gambling
275,How about then your-your kind of hunch about that?,1,reducing gambling
276,#NAME?,1,reducing gambling
277,"Yeah, yeah. It's a little bit here, a little bit there, so it then adds up, yeah? Yeah.",1,reducing gambling
278,"Okay. So, what other things have you've been open to at other times in your life when you've been open to-to new ideas and being able to talk about stuff, that may be tough to talk about?",1,reducing gambling
279,"Yeah, and-and, coming in, talking to a stranger, you know, and someone who can be honest to what you did, talking to a stranger, coming in this time, what do you sense about how you're doing so far?",1,reducing gambling
280,"Well, you have a choice about what you open up to me about. Absolutely, you have a choice about that, yeah. That coming, being on sentence, no, you don't have a choice about that, um, well, you have a choice, 'cause, I mean, you can choose not to come, and you'll be breached and get to head back to court.",1,reducing gambling
281,"Um, but you do have a choice about how you are here when we meet, and what-what we talk about here. So, um, you know, so you do have lots of choices within that. And, my sense is you're, sort of, you know, a young woman who will make some good choices about that 'cause you're not a bad person, and you know that.",1,reducing gambling
282,"So, it sounds like you're ready. You're ready to give this up.",1,reducing recidivism
283,"But, maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear.",1,reducing recidivism
284,So I wrote a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden.,1,smoking cessation 
285,"Um, I did wanna talk to you though. I'm a little bit concerned looking through his chart of how many ear infections he's had recently. And I-I noticed that you had checked the box that someone's smoking in the home. So I was wondering if you can tell me a little more about that.",1,smoking cessation 
286,You have a lot of things going on and smoking's kind of a way to relax and destress.,1,smoking cessation 
287,Sure. And it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him. Why did you make that decision?,1,smoking cessation 
288,"So on the one hand, you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the other hand, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems?",1,smoking cessation 
289,What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant?,1,smoking cessation 
290,"Right now, though, it feels almost too difficult to even manage or even to try?",1,smoking cessation 
291,How were you successful when you quit before?,1,smoking cessation 
292,Mm-hmm. The risks were so scary then that you were able to stop?,1,smoking cessation 
293,But they don't feel as scary to you now?,1,smoking cessation 
294,You're doing the best you can do.,1,smoking cessation 
295,Okay. But it sounds to me too like part of you really does want to quit?,1,smoking cessation 
296,It's on your to-do list. It's just not making it to the top?,1,smoking cessation 
297,"If you did decide to quit on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident, and you don't think you could do it and 10 is you feel pretty certain that you could, where do you think you fall right now?",1,smoking cessation 
298,"Well, what made you say five rather than two or three?",1,smoking cessation 
299,Where do you think we should go from here?,1,smoking cessation 
300,"Sure. Well, if you'd be interested, that's something I can definitely talk to you about. There are a lot of new options that can actually help people be way more successful in their attempt at quitting. There's different medications you can try.",1,smoking cessation 
301,"Okay. There's also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other people to go through it with you. And sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it, especially for people like you where smoking is such a stress reliever.",1,smoking cessation 
302,Sure. It feels like something that would take up a lot of time and maybe not fit into your life. I wonder if we could talk about some options that might fit into your life.,1,smoking cessation 
303,"Okay. Well, if you're willing, then we could set up another appointment where you could come in and we could talk more about that.",1,smoking cessation 
304,"Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown.",1,reducing alcohol consumption

It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know.

331,"So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that-",1,reducing alcohol consumption

338,#NAME?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
339,"Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're—",1,reducing alcohol consumption
340,"It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
341,"Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
342,"And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
343,"Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
344,Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
345,"Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
346,"Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or—",1,reducing alcohol consumption
347,And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
348,"Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
349,"So, what number do you think you'd say?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
350,"Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
351,"-and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
352,"Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
353,What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?,1,reducing alcohol consumption

355,Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you?,1,reducing alcohol consumption

358,"Okay. Well, very good. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know?",1,reducing alcohol consumption

So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it.

391,So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you've been experiencing some anxiety difficulties.,1,anxiety management
392,Okay. Is this the first time that you've left home?,1,anxiety management
393,Okay. So it has been quite a big step and a big change and it sounds like that that was what led you to go to your GP.,1,anxiety management
394,Okay. So how do you feel about being here today?,1,anxiety management
395,"Okay. So I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you've ended up kind of coming here today. So it sounds like you've been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years. Um, but just recently you moved out of home for the first time and, um, and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP. So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out?",1,anxiety management
396,Okay. So what other kinds of difficulties that you have been experiencing?,1,anxiety management
397,"Okay. So you said that, um, your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things. So they're, they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer, I guess that- that can be kind of a problem. And they're also stopping you or you feel like it's stunting you, uh, socially. You're not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people.",1,anxiety management
398,"So you're kind of worried about how, where this is going to lead to.",1,anxiety management
399,So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in about five or six years ago.,1,anxiety management
400,So you would have been about 19.,1,anxiety management
401,And what was happening around that time?,1,anxiety management
402,What kind of work is the most difficult for you in your job?,1,anxiety management
403,"Okay. So it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation and you think, ""People will look, people will stare, people will think I'm a weirdo."" So there's quite a lot about what you- what you think other the people will think. And how does that make you feel?",1,anxiety management
404,Okay. Can you give me an example of a-a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that.,1,anxiety management
405,"Yeah, time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety, you know, that you're describing, you felt that kick in.",1,anxiety management
406,It's quite interesting. Was that a fashion shoot or something?,1,anxiety management
407,So it wasn't what you expected?,1,anxiety management
408,So how long ago was that?,1,anxiety management
409,"So on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation?",1,anxiety management
410,"I can tell you're getting kind of anxious, even just thinking about that day.",1,anxiety management
411,So you're holding the camera very tightly.,1,anxiety management
412,W-why was that? Why was that helpful?,1,anxiety management
413,"So, I mean, you've already described it to me a little bit, but if you think about how you looked that day, how'd-how'd you say, how'd you think you looked?",1,anxiety management
414,Okay and what-what did you do about-- How did you try and conceal that or hide that?,1,anxiety management

420,Okay. What makes you so confident?,1,smoking cessation 
421,"Mm-hmm. And so in terms of, uh, uh, readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt, where do you think you fall on the scale of 1 to 10, where one is, I'm not considering it at all, and 10 is, I'm definitely ready, I wanna quit.",1,smoking cessation 
422,Okay. What made you say two instead of one?,1,smoking cessation 
423,"Well, there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke. We have products that can help to replace nicotine, which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your doctor could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke.",1,smoking cessation

429,"So, to heal-- feel healthy for yourself as well be a good role model for your kids?",1,weight loss
430,"So, if you did decide to get exercising more into your daily routine, how would you go about doing it?",1,weight loss
431,"So, it's that balance of doing something for yourself, but it sounds like you don't want that schedule to affect too much into your family routine.",1,weight loss
432,"So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not important and 10 being very important, where would you rate yourself on how important it is to start exercising more?",1,weight loss
433,"Okay, and how come not at like a five or a six?",1,weight loss
434,"So, to summarize, it's important for you to do this. You're starting to feel sluggish, you're not feeling healthy, and you know that you've got other people in your family watching you, and you want to be a good role model for them to know that this is gonna be just a part of your life, is your exercise. Yet for you, you're struggling just a little with the logistics of when to schedule time for you so it doesn't interfere too much with your family.",1,weight loss
435,"So, knowing this, what do you think you'll do next?",1,weight loss

So, uh, is it something to do with you getting out in three weeks? It must be pretty hard.",1,compliance with rules
439,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, you used to have contact with your mom, you know, almost every other night and now for just about a week, you haven't even gotten to talk to her. I can imagine that being pretty difficult. I remember you saying something about like your dad's birthday coming up?",1,compliance with rules
440,"Like I said, it's been, um, a long time and this is basically the first time that we've seen this behavior from you, so I know for a lot of other guys right before they get out, uh, a lot of anxiety, a lot of frustration comes around because they haven't been out in a while and then like the pressures of being on the outside are starting to settle in. So is that something might be going on with you?",1,compliance with rules

And-and do you appreciate how-- This is, uh, a risk to your life that there are some-some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms? It-it truly is something to take very, very seriously. I can't emphasize that enough.",0,asthma management
446,"Sal, what, uh, do you understand that what happened 6 years ago or 10 years ago, your asthma is progressively getting worse. You know very well that the puffers, the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher, and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone. You know this.",0,asthma management

464,"Um, have there been some times in the past where you were able to quit smoking completely?",1,smoking cessation 
465,"Okay. So, what's the longest you've ever gone without a cigarette including being in the hospital?",1,smoking cessation 
466,"Oh, three days. You know, that's a long time and I felt, you know, that's a pretty long time to go without smoking and I would imagine, I think that's pretty good.",1,smoking cessation 
467,What did you notice during those three days when you weren't smoking?,1,smoking cessation 
468,"And it sounds like it's paired, like a coffee and a cigarette. I mean, you know, probably hard to think about, ""How will I have a cup of coffee without a cigarette?""",1,smoking cessation 
469,"You know, and, um, that's actually, yeah, that's a-- I think it does become very paired with lots of different things. And, um, you might already know this, and so let me know if you do, um, because of the way cigarettes you're describing it and accurately is-- it is really what we call an almost perfect drug in a lot of ways. And-",1,smoking cessation 
470,It'll-it'll take a good usually 10 years off your life minimum.,1,smoking cessation 
471,Okay. What do you think when she says that to you?,1,smoking cessation 
472,"So, and I would- I would-- it really is because it wasn't like that 20 years ago.",1,smoking cessation 
473,"So, it's become harder to be a smoker. You light up a cigarette-cigarette and people make assumptions about you.",1,smoking cessation 
474,"So you shared that you're, um, here today because you're having some dissatisfaction with your body and your confidence and your mood and your energy. And you're looking for, um, some different patterns to kind of turn things around for yourself. And what I like to do as I get to know clients is-is let them know a little bit about my philosophies, about health and wellbeing. Um, but first, I'd love to hear what are your philosophies about health and wellbeing?",1,weight loss
475,"Yeah. Well, I'm so glad that you reached out for help, um, and just know that you're not alone. And-and so, yeah, is that okay if I share a little bit about, um, how I tend to work with clients on that topic?",1,weight loss
476,"Yeah. Well, um, first of all, I really am passionate about looking at the whole picture, um, physical health and emotional wellbeing and what I found in working with clients in the past is when, um, we make a focus of weight loss, sometimes, uh, physical health improves, but at the cost of emotional wellbeing.",1,weight loss
477,"Um, and also look at activities that enhance your mood. We can also take a look at some dietary patterns and see if-if there are ways you could tweak how you're fueling your body throughout the day, but at the same time, sort of letting go of what happens on the scale. Letting go of, um, the final, you know, weight outcome of that, and really focusing instead on healing your relationship with food and also adopting sustainable physical activity patterns. What do you make of all that?",1,weight loss
478,"Food is meant to be enjoyed, and it's a source of pleasure. So I'd want to help you certainly look for ways to add more fruits and vegetables and-and things that nourish your body, but also look for ways to add pleasure-",1,weight loss

485,"Um, you will be getting violations for that, and then if you get so many violations, I mean, we'd have to write a warrant for your arrest, which is looking more of, um, detention time.",1,charging battery

534,And you're feeling kind of concerned about that.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
535,"Okay. So, you're concerned about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best start you can.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
536,And you're wondering a little bit about this time that we're going to spend together.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
537,"So here you are today and, um, you're sharing that you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
538,"Kind of feels like You're between two worlds. In one world, you're preparing to be a mother and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good time and-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
539,"So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world maybe.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
540,"Okay. So, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
541,"So, you were thinking because your-your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be okay.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
542,"So, your gut is telling you what? Tell me about that.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
543,"And you really wanna do what's best for your babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
544,"So, you kind of have this identity, dual identity going on. I wanna be that person, yet, that person-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
545,"Mm. So, embraces this life of the picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the baby in this-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
546,"So, you don't wanna be that- that- that woman that's just sort of living in this house with the baby carriage, and at the same time, that world's kind of saying it's behind you.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
547,"It's just the scene that they're-they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. And so now, you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. You're not sure—",1,reducing alcohol consumption
548,"And you wanna be, um, take care of your baby as the baby's growing.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
549,You don't wanna let your baby down.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
550,"And at the same time, it's hard to let go of the past, but on the other hand, you're thinking, ""I don't have a choice. I've got to look this way."" Is that kind of what it feels like?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
551,"You put your heart there that the baby is really- it was almost kind of like a sign for you that was saying, ""This baby is giving you a kind of a new chance at life, or giving you a plan B,"" and you guys both get to decide what plan B is gonna look like.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
552,"While this baby's growing in you and you think of all the opportunities that could come out of this, there's a part of you that says, ""I'm still that same girl that was drinking and partying,"" and-and maybe not living the life you wanted to live.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
553,"While this baby feels like this is your second chance, you're wondering, ""Do I deserve that second chance?"" And then this other part of you that says, ""Why not? It's here and I wanna go for it.""",1,reducing alcohol consumption
554,"Mm-hmm. You got a lot of people around you that are kind of pulling it down, and it's kind of taking you back to the old life. And the baby is a constant reminder that there’s this new life ahead.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
555,"When you think about, you know, embracing this new life, and taking that different path, turning away from path A and moving into path B, how confident are you that you can take path B and be successful in raising this baby, and letting go with the drinking and the life that you were in-in path A?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
556,"Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that, what makes you say, ""I have to take that path""? What makes you feel like you need that?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
557,"This part of you that says, ""I don't have an option to-to-to make this life better,"" it's wondering, ""Do I have the confidence to be able to make that life a reality?"" What do you think you need to increase your confidence that you can do this?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
558,"So you're thinking that, um, once your friends see you with the baby in your arms that they too will see that there's a different path for them too?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
559,"Mm, kind of feel like you're pulled between two worlds there.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
560,"It's not easy to be in that world and also having that constant reminder that the baby is coming and this baby is saying, ""I want this better life,"" and you want to give the baby a better life too. Who can support you, do you think when-when you look around who's in your circle right now, who do you think can support you in moving towards path B?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
561,"And your parents are a support for you and support you from giving up the drinking, the alcohol use, that's something that they would support-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
562,That would be a concern for them as well as for you now.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
563,"Yeah. Is that something that, um, maybe you and I could meet again about-and talk about having those conversations with-with the family, maybe having conversations about, you know, the folks, your-your friends that are currently in the lifestyle that you were involved with, um, and then sort of what it would look like to go down path B, is that something that you would be open to meeting with me about again?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
564,Kind of feels like you're climbing Mt. Everest.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
565,"Oh, oh, you're talking about your friends.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
566,You're wondering if they're gonna kind of be like children and you're gonna be like the parent saying-,1,reducing alcohol consumption
567,You just wanna be like peers talking.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
568,And you want them to support you.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
569,"You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
570,Mm. You kind of wanna have the best of both worlds.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
571,"I want the friends and the relationship that I get from my friends, and at the same time, I don't want the party scene that goes with that.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
572,"Well, Nina, you know yourself best, and you know, you know, you know what your world looks like and what those, you know, like, you know the support that your friends give you and the support that you get from your family, you know that. And I-I really just wanna support you in being able to make those choices and have those conversations, and I wanna do whatever I can to support you with that. Um, and I'm just wondering if maybe we can kind of pick this up, um, in a next visit, but before we go there, I'm just wondering, is there some steps that you would be willing to kind of take or consider, uh, with-with regards to your drinking?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
573,"You're concerned about the health of your baby. I just would love to share with you, Nina, that every day without alcohol is a good day for your baby, and you know, starting today to have zero alcohol is a great start, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of something you'd be open to as no more alcohol at this point.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
574,"Okay, sounds like this is really important to you. You want to make this happen.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
575,Is there anything that I can support you with before we wrap up as far as giving up alcohol today?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
576,You kind of got a reality check today.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
577,"You did really well talking with me today, and I thank you so much for just sharing your heart.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
578,"Nice to meet you, too. Thanks for coming in today.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
579,Yeah. Tell me a little bit about yourself.,1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
580,"Yeah, you're feeling a little bit dissatisfied with your health patterns?",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
581,"Okay, so you're feeling some low energy and you know, in the past, when you've been more active and eating differently, you've had more energy?",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
582,"Yeah. Tell me more about that, those previous times that you've been active.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
583,"You had energy, and you were like the Energizer Bunny, just keep going and going and going.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
584,"So your days are just as full now that you're working and a career person, um, and your energy level isn't what it used to be. What-- Do you have any ideas about why that might have shifted?",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
585,"Right. So in the past, it wasn't up to you whether you had the choice to go be physically active. Now it is up to you, and-and you're looking back at the last few years and saying, I wanna do things differently.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
586,I want to be more physically active than I've been.,1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
587,Great. And you've noticed a mood enhancement effect of exercise.,1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
588,Tell me more about that. What do you notice specifically about your mood on the days you're physically active?,1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
589,"Yeah, you feel more accomplished and-and you feel less irritated by the small stuff.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
590,"Great. Well, let me see if I've got this all. You came to Arizona six months ago, you're trying to figure out new rhythms and patterns for yourself. You're looking back at the past few years, and in college, you were real active because you were an athlete, and now it's more up to you about making that choice of physical activity, and you're discovering that, um, not being active has affected your energy level and your mood, and that's something you're looking for more of, both of those things, energy and-and a mood booster.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
591,Yeah. Tell me more about your weight concerns. When did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?,1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
592,"Mm-hmm. Okay, so it sounds like a sort of a vicious cycle and-and maybe the lacking physical activity has made you feel less confident in yourself. I wonder if that's also a piece of this puzzle since you mentioned that's been a big difference from what was happening in the past.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
593,"Okay. So you had a pretty strong self-confidence, pretty strong body image all the way up until a few months ago and, um, you're hoping to kind of get back to that place where you feel good about yourself.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
594,"My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you?",1,changing approach to disease
595,"Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right?",1,changing approach to disease
596,Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today?,1,changing approach to disease
597,All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems?,1,changing approach to disease
598,- and some of them sound-,1,changing approach to disease
599,Okay. And how long has this been going on?,1,changing approach to disease
600,Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday?,1,changing approach to disease
601,Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before?,1,changing approach to disease
602,"Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the-",1,changing approach to disease
603,#NAME?,1,changing approach to disease
604,- depending on what your stomach's doing?,1,changing approach to disease
605,Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems?,1,changing approach to disease
606,You got the tube down-down from the top?,1,changing approach to disease
607,Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that.,1,changing approach to disease
608,"Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests?",1,changing approach to disease
609,Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years.,1,changing approach to disease
610,You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach.,1,changing approach to disease
611,"Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies-",1,changing approach to disease
612,"- and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough.",1,changing approach to disease
613,#NAME?,1,changing approach to disease
614,"Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life?",1,changing approach to disease
615,Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed.,1,changing approach to disease
616,"Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed-",1,changing approach to disease
617,#NAME?,1,changing approach to disease
618,It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do.,1,changing approach to disease
619,"So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now?",1,changing approach to disease
620,Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then?,1,changing approach to disease
621,And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad?,1,changing approach to disease
622,Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay.,1,changing approach to disease
623,Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years.,1,changing approach to disease
624,"So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night?",1,changing approach to disease
625,"Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years.",1,changing approach to disease
626,You've-you've tried a variety of medications-,1,changing approach to disease
627,- from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations-,1,changing approach to disease
628,- a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the-,1,changing approach to disease
629,"Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today?",1,changing approach to disease
630,Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests?,1,changing approach to disease
631,"Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests.",1,changing approach to disease
632,"Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of-",1,changing approach to disease
633,-your life and causing you a lot-,1,changing approach to disease
634,"Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy-",1,changing approach to disease
635,#NAME?,1,changing approach to disease
636,"And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility?",1,changing approach to disease
637,"Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you-",1,changing approach to disease
638,- I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems.,1,changing approach to disease
639,"Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down.",1,changing approach to disease
640,"Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling-",1,changing approach to disease
641,#NAME?,1,changing approach to disease
642,"Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up-",1,changing approach to disease
643,"- with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally-",1,changing approach to disease
644,- improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking.,1,changing approach to disease
645,"Well, I guess if we- if we did decide to-to work together like this-",1,changing approach to disease
646,"- in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be-",1,changing approach to disease
647,- pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that-that we're missing.,1,changing approach to disease
648,I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun to talk about it-,1,changing approach to disease
649,"- and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back. Perhaps if you're booked in for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach.",1,changing approach to disease
650,"And perhaps if you could also bring your-your tablets in or-or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound, Barbara?",1,changing approach to disease
651,I think that would be a good- a good start.,1,changing approach to disease
652,"So, shall I see you again next week?",1,changing approach to disease
653,"Okay. All right. Thank you, Barbara.",1,changing approach to disease
654,"All right. So where we left last time, you were going away to think about a few things and to, um, develop some sort of plan of action. How'd it go? What were you up to?",1,reducing violence
655,"So you've rung your mom, had a chat to her.",1,reducing violence
656,Any other whānau members? You talked about your brothers and sisters last time.,1,reducing violence
657,What are you not sure about?,1,reducing violence
658,"Okay. Just sort of interested, when you rang your mom and, um, told her what's happening, how difficult was it to talk about the issue of violence and being violent towards your partner?",1,reducing violence
659,"We-we talked about, uh, last time that this is hard stuff and that, um, we are prepared to kind of do the hard yard. So you've gone away, you've talked to your folks, put it out there about your issue of violence? Um, I'm thinking about, uh, with-with Tristan and the whole alcohol issue there. So it sounds like to me if you've- you've started to put quite a bit of stuff in place.",1,reducing violence
660,"Grand. You talked a little bit about, uh, you'd really like to get back with Kristie?",1,reducing violence
661,"Okay. So what do you think you're gonna need to do to show her and others, uh, to convince them that you are serious?",1,reducing violence
662,"Hi, Sarah, it's great to meet you. My name is Delwyn, and I'm a counselor here at the clinic. And I heard from your nurse practitioner that you recently had an annual exam in which the topics of smoking and alcohol use came up. Would you mind filling me in a little bit about that?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
663,"So, you've decided you wanna cut back on your smoking a little bit, but, you're not really concerned about your drinking.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
664,It's a nice sort of form of stress relief.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
665,Sort of escape from your hectic schedule.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
666,"So, you're working, and then, on top of that, juggling being a single mom and going to school?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
667,"Yeah, it does. It sounds like a lot that you're trying to deal with, and it makes sense that you feel like you need some kind of break or reward.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
668,"So, you're drinking, perhaps, two drinks a day. Um, and I'm wondering, what have you heard about the recommendations for drinking levels?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
669,"Okay, will you be interested in hearing about those recommendations?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
670,"Okay. Well, so, the recommendation for women is to have no more than three drinks a day, and no more than seven drinks over the course of a week. Yeah, um, and, really, the reason for those recommendations is to just reduce the risk that people have trouble with accidents, or chronic diseases. Like certain types of cancers, or high blood pressure, and then also psychological problems. I don't know what you think about all that?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
671,"It just doesn't seem that abnormal to you, especially when you compare it with your family.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
672,"Yeah, you really feel like you need that reward.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
673,"And then it also sounds like, um, your drinking has perhaps increased a little bit over time?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
674,"So, let me summarize a little bit what you've told me. It sounds like you have a pretty hectic, stressful life, and you really feel like you need some kind of-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
675,"-reward or stress relief. Um, and then, on the other hand, you've noticed, um, that your drinking has increased a little bit over time. And also that the more stressed you're fe- you feel, the more you're inclined to drink.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
676,"So, I'm wondering, have you noticed any problems from your drinking?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
677,"So, you've noticed that it's starting to call to you a little bit in the evenings.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
678,"Yeah. And so, it sounds like there's a bit of a dilemma there, because-- And I guess we should be clear, it's not the occasional drink that's an issue. Um, it's-it's really the quantity of drinking, and-and whether your drinking is escalating and interfering with things that are, perhaps, more important.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
679,And you've perhaps never seen it in that light before.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
680,"So, it seems like it would be really difficult to change because it's something that's really important to you right now.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
681,"So, I guess I'm wondering if you've given any thought to other ways in which you could cope with stress without relying on the drinking so much.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
682,"So, if you could somehow tackle some of these stressful issues, um, that could make a difference, and, what-what would that be, for example?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
683,"So, having more reliable childcare could make a big difference.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
684,"And it sounds like your mom has been an option in the past, but perhaps not so much anymore.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
685,"So, one thing that could make a big difference is if you could figure out some sort of more reliable, affordable childcare, and that would help you not want to drink as much.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
686,"Yeah. It-it sounds like, um, you know, money could make a big difference, and you are working full time and trying to go to school to address that in the long run. Um, but on the other hand, you know, it sounds like you have some other ideas of cope- of how you might cope with stress better. Um, so, I guess I'm-I'm wondering, given our conversation so far, kind of where you are with everything.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
687,"Um, we started off talking about how your drinking has sort of drifted into a risky area, and it would be advisable to cut back. Um, but it sounds like you feel like that's fairly important to you and not something you necessarily want to do. But on the other hand, we've talked about ways in which that perhaps could be made a bit easier, but I'm not sure if you're ready to tackle that or pursue that right now. I'm just kind of wondering where you are.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
688,"So, um, it would perhaps be helpful if you could narrow it down to just one thing, and what would that be?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
689,"Okay. Well, one thing you could consider is talking to one of our social workers, they sort of specialize in helping people who have a lot on their plate identifying resources that they may need, uh, things you haven't thought of or aren't aware of. So, I don't know, would you be interested in doing something like that?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
690,"Okay. Great. Well, I can definitely set you up with that, and you can-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
691,"-um, try to tackle, um, your childcare issue, um, with some assistance. Is there anything else you'd like to do, um, for example, would you be interested in talking with me again, um, just as things progress?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
692,"Yeah. So, these are not problems that are going to go away in a week. It's going to take some time to resolve. Okay, great. So, um, it sounds like we have a couple of things, uh, to pursue.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
693,Would you be interested in perhaps thinking about setting a goal with respect to your drinking?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
694,Okay. Try to cut back a bit and see how that goes.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
695,"Okay. So, you can give it a go and, I think doing managing, you might just learn a little bit about how easy or difficult it's going to be, and-and also what it's like to cope with stress in other ways.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
696,"Okay, great. I look forward to talking next time.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
697,Mm-hmm. And there was a war going on?,1,smoking cessation 
698,"And the social stigma, because you don't want your daughter to think of you like that, whatever that- that as a smoker, you know. You know there're people who make the assumption and it- it sounds like those are more important to you than the medical things, and who cares why it's important?",1,smoking cessation 
699,It doesn't matter. So what- what ideas do you have about what might be most helpful for you in quitting smoking?,1,smoking cessation 
700,"So that was helpful for you that it's a, um, I can't remember. I know what you're trying to get a little ball.",1,smoking cessation 
701,"But it might be helpful if you- if you quit or it's, you know, it did if you were gonna decrease or whatever, to see how much better you're doing with the ball going up and your lung capacity increasing, is it?",1,smoking cessation

You tried the Chan- the Chantix, meditation, you like that so, um, I can run some ideas that some other clients have used [crosstalk]-",1,smoking cessation

704,"Yes, it is true. Yeah. It is. I mean, people don't come walking through the door who are not interested in it, you know? So, um, yeah, so that's-- So you'd be interested in something like that and, um, what- what other ideas have you thought about that would work for you?",1,smoking cessation

706,"Um, because I know you mentioned you tried the Chantix. Um, what have you tried? Uh, Zyban or Wellbutrin?",1,smoking cessation 
707,"It's the same thing. It's Wellbutrin, and when they found out by accident through what we call serendipity that you know what, Viagra. [laughs] That when- when people were on Wellbutrin that they tended to decrease and stop smoking, and, um, there were a couple of different reasons for that. Number one, people tend to get depressed when they quit smoking, because it puts you in such a state of deprivation and, um also-- well, so Wellbutrin really is a good antidepressant for them.",1,smoking cessation 
708,"The other thing is its a slight stimulatory effect and when people go off nicotine which is a stimulant the-they tend to get pretty tired overheard-- you know it's the opposite of however the nicotine makes them feel. And the Wellbutrin kind of with stimul-- you know stimulatory enough. [crosstalk] [unintelligible 00:05:56] And I-- the last I've read, and I've not kept real current about it, but I'm wondering about the-- what your thoughts are if any about the-- any of the nicotine replacements like the gum patch, the inhaler.",1,smoking cessation

712,"Union break. Yeah. le-leverage, and you know so it's something else you might know about nicotine is, um is that actually depending on how you smoke it, it can- it can be stimulant when you want it to be a stimulant if you smoke it in short, shallow puffs and then it can be a depressant like after a meal and you take longer inhalations, and it really tends to act on your central nervous system as a depressant. So it kind of does whatever you want at any given moment and yet there is this price that you pay",1,smoking cessation 
713,"Financially. Right, getting back to the finances and you know, you know, you know I'm thinking your daughter what a pain but it's become the finances the emphysema. I'm really-- because I would think that in 10 years, how much are you smoking now?",1,smoking cessation

738,"Well, thank you, Tanya, for meeting with me today and talking about this. So, there is something I'd like to ask you that we can kind of discuss in our conversation is what's one thing about yourself or something in your life that you'd like to change that maybe you've been feeling kind of ambivalent about?",1,increasing self-confidence
739,"Yeah. This anxiety is this obstacle for you and it sounds like it, then you're just not feeling confident that you could do it and do it successfully to this exam.",1,increasing self-confidence
740,"And so, it's easier for you to just not do it.",1,increasing self-confidence
741,"Yeah. So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not confident at all, 10 being very confident. How confident are you that you feel you can manage your anxiety in regards to taking this exam?",1,increasing self-confidence
742,"Okay. So, four or five. How combat, like, not like a two or three.",1,increasing self-confidence
743,"Yeah. Yeah, and you also mentioned that you've actually made the appointment that you have to take this exam.",1,increasing self-confidence
744,And before you've been putting it off.,1,increasing self-confidence
745,"Okay. So, you've made this appointment before in the past and the anxiety has kind of taken over where you've rescheduled it.",1,increasing self-confidence
746,"And this time, it seems like it's a little bit different this time. How come this time you feel like you might not reschedule this time around?",1,increasing self-confidence
747,So that's really encouraging you thinking about how good you'll feel afterwards once it's done and taken.,1,increasing self-confidence
748,I'd love to hear from you. When was the time in the past that you were feeling anxious about something and you actually did it and it turned out well?,1,increasing self-confidence
749,"Yeah. And that must've been really brave for you to do something that seems really daunting at first, yet you were really successful at it.",1,increasing self-confidence
750,"Um, how do you think you could relate that to what you're dealing with now?",1,increasing self-confidence
751,So for you to create opportunities to create those moments that you can have that feeling again,1,increasing self-confidence
752,"And you just mentioned too, you feel really proud of yourself.",1,increasing self-confidence
753,"So to end our conversation, how do you think you couldn't move? You originally said, you were at four or five, what would have to happen to get you to like a seven, to feel more confident?",1,increasing self-confidence
754,So that positive self-talk could really go a long way for you?,1,increasing self-confidence
755,"So to summarize, it sounds like you are still feeling kind of anxious about this test coming up, you've rescheduled it, um, over the past couple years. Yet, this time around, you seem more confident to just get it done. And you've even mentioned times in the past where you were feeling anxious and you were successful about it and that you felt proud about yourself. And you liked the way it means, you see yourself and how others saw you, and it seems like y-you're ready to finish this exam and-and remind yourself that you can be successful?",1,increasing self-confidence

770,It has a lot of alcohol in it.,0,reducing alcohol consumption

772,"Yeah. Um, so we call it high-risk because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you're gonna have some bad consequences from drinking like that. So, you know, things like, um, having car accidents, or other accidents, or getting in fights, or, you know, sexual assault, or health problems, or developing alcoholism. Have you thought about those things?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
773,"Okay. So it's, um, so it's good, because you're not drinking and driving, but you're still really drinking a lot. Um, and yeah. Okay. So, let's-let's talk a little bit about that, how you might be able to make some changes. Because I think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
774,"So, um, do you think you could quit drinking or?",0,reducing alcohol consumption

780,"And, um, I think you should probably stop as soon as possible, like this weekend.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
781,"Um, so the way this normally works is, you know, we set you a goal, and then I'll have you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple of weeks and make sure that you actually stopped. Um, and so what do you think about that?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
782,"Okay. And then, um, you know, like, are your friends in band drinking?",0,reducing alcohol consumption

785,"Well, you know, one good option would be to just review with them review with them all the bad things about alcohol. You can say, you know, ""I thought about it, and I realized it's gonna mess up my schoolwork. And you know, it's really a lot of risk for my health."" ""I don't want to become an alcoholic."" Um, you know, ""I don't want to get liver disease."", ""I don't want to end up driving drunk or getting into accidents-",0,reducing alcohol consumption

794,It seems like that doesn't-isn't really a concern for you at this time?,1,compliance with rules

796,"You know that I will be stopping by every day just to make sure that you're here and following and-and responding to your GPS and making sure that that's charged up every day and that, um, if you're leaving the house without permission, that we will be aware of that as well. Um, and kinda just to get to know you as well when I come for these visits 'cause, um, you know that's kind of my role as your caseworker is just to-to monitor your day-to-day stuff.",1,compliance with rules
797,It does kinda come off as nosy at times I'm sure.,1,compliance with rules
798,"I know uh, some clients have struggled with understanding that I really do care about you. And you know that when we first met that you had expressed a goal of, um, getting off this program as quickly as possible.",1,compliance with rules
799,So I know just kinda being here when you need to be here is one way of doing that.,1,compliance with rules
800,Yet you still can seem kind of annoyed that this is something that we still have to do.,1,compliance with rules
801,So you're still kinda concerned that you're not quite sure if you will be able to do this successfully?,1,compliance with rules
802,"Um, and-and I'm sure that does seem kind of confusing too 'cause I'm sure you've got a lot of other people involved in your life right now with the courts I'm sure, I know that your mom is concerned about you as well and there's this one other person kinda checking in on you as well.",1,compliance with rules
803,Yeah. And there is and I'm sure that it is really struggling at times too.,1,compliance with rules

805,What would be some ways you could go about being able to get your freedom back?,1,compliance with rules
806,"Mm-hmm, yup that's one step, just sign the papers when I come by. Even though it seems like it's kinda annoying at times, it is something that we're contracted to do.",1,compliance with rules
807,What are some other ways you feel like you can get your freedom back?,1,compliance with rules
808,"That's okay. Well, I know that you are making an effort. I do appreciate then and when-when I do stop by that you still sign the paperwork even though you feel like it's annoying at times. So, thank you for, uh, at least doing that.",1,compliance with rules

811,"Okay. I see that you filled out our, um, alcohol and drug questionnaire. Is it okay if we go through this together?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
812,Okay. What we talk about is confidential. I only tell your parents about what we say if you give your permission or if I become worried about a danger to-to you or to someone else. Does that make sense?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
813,"Okay, so how many do you usually have at a time?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
814,"Okay. So, you drink with friends, sort of three or four beers or mixed drinks, one or two times a month. How long have you been doing that?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
815,"Okay. So, it sounds like you feel relaxed and have fun when you're drinking with friends and you like the taste.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
816,"Okay. I'm also curious, are there any parts about your alcohol use that you don't like?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
817,"Have you ever experienced a-a blackout, like when you've been drinking and you wake up and you don't remember what happened?",1,reducing alcohol consumption

819,Mm-hmm. Have you told your mother that you drink with your friends?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
820,"Okay. I see on the questionnaire that you have not ridden in a car with someone who's been drinking and you haven't driven a car, um, after you've been drinking. Is that correct?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
821,"That's great. And I hope you continue to avoid those things. As your doctor, I want you to know that I'm concerned about your drinking. When teens drink, things can go wrong, like injuring yourself. Even when you don't drink too excess, though, your brain is still developing and is very sensitive to the effects of alcohol.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
822,"That's why I recommend that all my adolescent patients not drink at all. So if you were thinking today about how ready you feel to stop drinking alcohol on a scale of zero to ten, with zero not being ready at all and ten feeling very ready, what number would you pick?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
823,"A five? So, I'm curious. Why didn't you pick a lower number like a two or three that would mean you're only a little bit ready to stop drinking?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
824,[chuckles] Have you ever tried not drinking or stopping drinking?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
825,"So, how long do you think you could go without drinking?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
826,Do you think you could go two months without drinking?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
827,Okay. What things would make it easier for you to not drink?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
828,Anything else to make things easier for you?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
829,"Okay. Is there anybody in your life that you can talk to about this, who give you some support for not drinking?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
830,"Great. So you've come up with some reasons to stop drinking, like having hangovers and throwing up and getting into trouble. And you've developed some strategies to-to try to not drink, like spending more time with friends who don't drink or having non-alcoholic drinks when people around you are drinking alcohol. I think that's a great plan. I'm really proud of you for giving this a try. How about if I have you make an appointment for two months from now and then I'll see you back and we can see how things are going?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
831,"Um, I noticed some yelling going on in the house, what's going on?",1,opening up
832,So nothing you want to talk about right now?,1,opening up
833,My guess is you're probably involved in that.,1,opening up
834,"Okay, I understand that sometimes if you're feeling angry or upset about something, the last thing you want to do is share with your caseworker at that time, but, um, you know I am here for you, and if there's anything you ever want to talk about or share with me, that is something that I would love to-to here, and I'll just see sit here and listen if that's something that you would find helpful.",1,opening up
835,"Okay. You know what? I-it seems like things have been really a struggle for you lately, and I have noticed that you haven't been in the best mood, so I'm really- I am concerned about you, but again, it's your choice if that's something that you feel like you want to share with me.",1,opening up
836,"All right, well, you know I will be by later today. If, um, you have any questions or if you want to talk, um, otherwise, again, I'll stop by and call you later.",1,opening up
837,You probably think that I'm going to get on your case about that or something.,1,diabetes management

839,"Yeah, clearly, you made a decision because you didn't want to stand out in some way I'm guessing. So, let's-let's talk more about that. Tell me where would you like to take this?",1,diabetes management
840,"All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but-",1,reducing gambling
841,"Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time?",1,reducing gambling
842,"Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, ""Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together-",1,reducing gambling
843,"Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles?",1,reducing gambling
844,"Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, ""Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable."" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past?",1,reducing gambling
845,"Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together?",1,reducing gambling
846,"So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if—",1,reducing gambling
847,"Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, ""Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,"" that would be really helpful.",1,reducing gambling
848,"Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money.",1,reducing gambling
849,"So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort?",1,reducing gambling
850,"Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah.",1,reducing gambling
851,"About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life?",1,reducing gambling
852,-your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit?,1,reducing gambling
853,"Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out.",1,reducing gambling
854,"Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them?",1,reducing gambling
855,"Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with—",1,reducing gambling
856,"Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford-",1,reducing gambling
857,"-'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think?",1,reducing gambling
858,"Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems?",1,reducing gambling
859,"Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams?",1,reducing gambling
860,"Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps.",1,reducing gambling
861,"Yeah? Yeah. ""Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,"" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time-",1,reducing gambling
862,"-wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, ""Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?"" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point.",1,reducing gambling
863,"And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah?",1,reducing gambling
864,"When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point?",1,reducing gambling
865,"Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what—",1,reducing gambling
866,"Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh?",1,reducing gambling
867,"Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go?",1,reducing gambling
868,"Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream?",1,reducing gambling
869,Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront?,1,reducing gambling
870,"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that?",1,reducing gambling
871,"No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you?",1,reducing gambling
872,"Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment.",1,reducing gambling
873,#NAME?,1,reducing gambling
874,Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that?,1,reducing gambling

876,"Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt.",1,reducing gambling
877,"Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isn't it?",1,reducing gambling
878,"It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so?",1,reducing gambling
879,Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah?,1,reducing gambling
880,"Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and-",1,reducing gambling

883,"Yeah, yeah. Something we can- we can do over the next while is-is really get some very concrete things in place to support you to do that.",1,reducing gambling
884,Yeah. So what's one thing you can do between now and the next time we meet?,1,reducing gambling
885,"Yeah. Okay, so sounds like so-some budget to buy stuff will be helpful.",1,reducing gambling
886,"Yeah, and of the things that-that we often put people in touch with here is some budget advice service, it's a great service here, um, and something that you can get to.",1,reducing gambling
887,So let's talk about how we can organize a-a meeting with them.,1,reducing gambling
888,"Okay. Um, but we were talking a little bit earlier-- earlier in our conversation, you had said that you did feel like it was maybe causing some of your agitation. So it's a little bit of, I'm not sure of what-- Um, so where are we? Did-did you-- do you feel like you do have some agitation out of coffee, or is it just no problem at all?",1,reducing coffee consumption

892,Yeah. How about frequency? Do you feel like you're good on how much coffee you're drinking?,1,reducing coffee consumption
893,"Yeah, yeah. What would happen if you-- if you looked at, maybe reducing that with that habit? Would that get rid of maybe some of the things that are problematic?",1,reducing coffee consumption

898,Would it be okay if I shared a little more information with you about the flu vaccine and the importance of it?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
899,"So you're right that you're young and healthy and you don't have a lot of complicating illnesses that mean that you would probably do okay if you got the flu. But we do know that the elderly are more at risk, pregnant people, babies are at risk of having serious complications from the flu, and by you getting the vaccine, that helps prevent you from passing it on to other people.",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure

901,"Hi, Nick. Thank you for completing the CRAFFT questionnaire. I also appreciate you sharing some information about yourself.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
902,"I understand. So tell me, how often do you drink?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
903,"I'm gonna make sure I understand. You have tried drinking a couple of times, and you almost got in trouble once. Did I get that right?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
904,"As your provider, I'm a little concerned about your health. Drinking alcohol could harm you, and I would like to share some information with you. Is that okay?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
905,"I understand. You're just experimenting with alcohol. Then, how about if you share with me what the effects of alcohol are?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
906,Are you surprised what that might be true?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
907,"Well, you might not be drinking that much, and other kids are also trying alcohol. I'd like to share with you the risk of using. Alcohol and drugs could really harm you because your brain is still changing. It also-- you're very high risk for becoming addicted. Alcohol and drugs could also interfere with your role in life and your goals, especially in sports, and it could cause unintended sex.

910,Scholarship will really help you achieving your goals.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
911,I would like to share with you these materials to show the risk of drinking at younger age. I also wanted to encourage you to think about these risks. What do you think about that?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
912,Okay. Why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself?,0,reducing alcohol consumption
913,Okay. And what do you like to do for fun?,0,reducing alcohol consumption
914,"Mm-hmm, and when you and your friends are hanging out, and what- what do you do? Do you go to football games, go to parties?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
915,Okay. And what kind of hobbies do you have?,0,reducing alcohol consumption
916,"Oh, cool. What are your plans for after high school?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
917,That's great. What do you think you'll study?,0,reducing alcohol consumption

920,Okay. And do you know where you're going to apply to college?,0,reducing alcohol consumption
921,"Okay. Cool. And, you know, what made you decide maybe law school or-or journalism?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
922,"Mm-hmm, so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
923,"Okay, and so that's maybe like 20 times a year.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
924,So that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then?,0,reducing alcohol consumption
925,"Okay. Um, so the most you've ever, ever had is two drinks in a day.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
926,"Okay. Interesting. So, do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
927,"Okay. What about at these parties you're going to, are there other kids there who are drinking a lot?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
928,"Mm-hmm, so, you know, even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. Did you know that?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
929,"Yeah, so, there, I mean, a lot of the other dangers of drinking, like, um, not just car accidents, but you can have other accidents, you know, people, um, you know, will fall or, um, you know, break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and falling down or, you know, as a girl, it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
930,"You know, especially if you've been drinking, then, you know, you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you. Did- have you thought about that?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
931,"And then their parents find out or the school finds out and, you know, we have a no-tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol, and really can get you into trouble, and it could put your whole college career in jeopardy. Have you thought about that?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
932,"Mm-hmm. Okay. Hmm. So, I mean, I guess what we need to do then is kinda talk about some goals for how to be-",0,reducing alcohol consumption
933,"Um, obviously, you shouldn't be drinking at all. Um, what do you think about that?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
934,"Mm-hmm. So, do you think you can quit?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
935,"Okay. So, I'm going to write down then that you've decided to quit.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
936,"And, um, that's gonna be your goal, and that's great, you know, that's really why we're here, is to talk about that and-and make sure that you come to that decision. Um, so, I guess, can you quit this weekend then?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
937,"Okay, and then what about your friends who are still drinking?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
938,"Okay, and-and what if they won't?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
939,"Yeah. Probably if your friends won't quit drinking, you should just find new friends.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
940,"'Cause, you know, the problem is if they're drinking, they're gonna pressure you into drinking and then you're gonna feel awkward and, you know, you're gonna be stuck and-and not know what to do and really you'd just be better off probably without them. If they're- if they're the kind of people who are gonna keep drinking-",0,reducing alcohol consumption
941,-they're probably not a good influence.,0,reducing alcohol consumption
942,"Okay, so, um, that's great 'cause it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you. Um, let's see. I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
943,"Okay, so, yeah, just another reason why you probably need to just quit then. Um, okay, yeah. I-- Okay, so, like I said, I'm gonna right down here that you've decided to quit and, um, uh, you know, I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably in the next semester sometime, so we can kinda check-in and-and make sure that, you know, that's still going well-",0,reducing alcohol consumption
944,"-and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking. Um, is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here?",0,reducing alcohol consumption
945,"Okay. You're sure? Okay. All right. Um, well, that's probably it then. You can, uh, head back to class and-and thanks for coming in.",0,reducing alcohol consumption
946,"Um, we were talking a little bit earlier, and you said you wanted to talk about exercising.",1,more exercise / increasing activity
947,"Well, I mean, I think you just need to maybe sit down and write down a list of reasons why you need to get back to the gym, and then on the other side of the list, put down, you know, um, ideas about what's going to help you get there.",1,more exercise / increasing activity
948,What gym do you belong to?,1,more exercise / increasing activity

951,"Yeah. So why-why do you want to-- what do you wanna do with that? You want to look different, or--?",1,more exercise / increasing activity
952,"Okay. Yeah, because your-your health really, to me, it's more important than your-your looks. I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand what you're saying, but, you know, it'd be great to get back in those jeans, but—",1,more exercise / increasing activity
953,"Mm-hmm. Well, I think you know what to do. You've done it before.",1,more exercise / increasing activity
954,Yeah. Just a matter-- You just gotta do it.,1,more exercise / increasing activity
955,"Yeah. And so that might mean, you know, like giving up an hour's sleep, getting up an hour earlier in the day, and going there and getting it done then. That's what I do.",1,more exercise / increasing activity

957,"Do you mind if I take a look at your arm, please?",1,reducing drug use
958,"Okay. Well, I don't see any redness. Um, can you go ahead and touch that Miguel, and tell me if it feels warm to you or if it hurts?",1,reducing drug use
959,"Thanks. Just so you know, when I talk to patients about drug use, my job is to be helpful. I'm not going to tell you what to do or what you should do. What I can do is share some information and be a resource. Does that make sense?",1,reducing drug use
960,Right. What else can you tell me about your heroin use?,1,reducing drug use
961,A couple of times a week. And where do you get your syringes?,1,reducing drug use
962,"Uh, what one do you remember?",1,reducing drug use
963,"Yeah, it sounds like your health is important to you.",1,reducing drug use
964,And you showed up today to take care of your migraines.,1,reducing drug use
965,"So, uh, you wrote on here that you've experienced withdrawal symptoms when you've stopped using in the past, is that right?",1,reducing drug use
966,That sounds awful. What do you do when that happens?,1,reducing drug use
967,Okay. How else does injecting heroin impact your life?,1,reducing drug use
968,"Yeah. You want to stay healthy. I'm curious, what do you like about using heroin?",1,reducing drug use
969,And what about your use do you not like?,1,reducing drug use
970,"Mm-hmm. So on one hand, using heroin feels like an escape from things you don't want to think about. On the other hand, it puts you at risk for an overdose in infections.",1,reducing drug use
971,"So weighing what you like and don't like about your use, where do you want to go from here? What do you want to do differently?",1,reducing drug use
972,"Well, some patients who inject heroin are interested in a medication called Suboxone. It reduces cravings, withdrawal symptoms without making you high. Some patients want information on how to inject drugs more safely or where to get new syringes. Other patients want to carry Naloxone which is a drug that can prevent one from overdosing.",1,reducing drug use
973,Your housemate may be willing to give you Narcan if they see you overdosing.,1,reducing drug use
974,Anything else you want to do about your use?,1,reducing drug use
975,So it sounds like you have two goals right now. You want to tell your housemate about where you keep the Narcan in case you overdose and you want some information on how to inject safely?,1,reducing drug use
976,"How confident are you to do these two things? On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 meaning not ready at all and 10 meaning very ready, what number would you pick?",1,reducing drug use
977,Okay. You're very ready. Why do you think you picked a 10 instead of a lower number like 8?,1,reducing drug use
978,What kind of plan could you put in place to make sure you meet these goals?,1,reducing drug use
979,That's great. And how do you want to get the information on injecting?,1,reducing drug use
980,Okay. I'd like to hear how your plan worked out for you if you're willing to come back for another appointment. I look forward to hearing about what worked for you and what was challenging say in four weeks.,1,reducing drug use

That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going?",1,more exercise / increasing activity

1050,"You can't, no, not one of mine. So, um when are you thinking you might want to do this?",1,smoking cessation 
1051,"Okay. Yeah, no, all those things are good. I mean, I think you know, the will- picking a quit date has been found to be really effective. And, um, uh, I know you had talked earlier and then we'll end in just a couple minutes, but about, you know, like, the willingness or the readiness and most-- a lot of people, a lot of my clients have shared with me that when they woke up that morning, they truly had no idea that was going to be their last cigarette.",1,smoking cessation 
1052,"No. Or- or some of them didn't have an exact date, but m-more importantly, was they-they just didn't know that was the day.",1,smoking cessation 
1053,"Right, right. It's just like you-you-you-- Some people pick a quit date, like January 1st is still the most popular quit date—",1,smoking cessation 
1054,There's a smoke update coming up.,1,smoking cessation 
1055,"Actually, you would be amazed how many people do it.",1,smoking cessation 
1056,"Yeah, yeah, they really do, and smokers. Yeah, and drinkers, they do, yes. Yeah.",1,smoking cessation 
1057,"So, for you, it's your, you know, it sounds like you really want to be prepared.",1,smoking cessation 
1058,"And yet, on some level, you know, that it's gonna be a lot of hard work for you because of, you know, you've already known how anxious you get about a stash-",1,smoking cessation 
1059,"So if you have a stash Nicorette gum if you decide to use it, I mean, you'd have to have other stashes, you know.",1,smoking cessation 
1060,"Yeah. So, so if-if your doctor says it's okay with the Wellbutrin, one-- uh, we see very little if any weight gain-",1,smoking cessation 
1061,"Yeah. And, um, the same with the Nicorette gum, because it- nicotine is an appetite suppressant.",1,smoking cessation 
1062,"If you will. And that's if you decide you want to try a replacement therapy and that's what we call it and it-it kind of sounds from what you've described with your fear about you know, what it would be like of the withdrawal and everything like that. W-why you don't have to do it that way, you don't have to go cold-cold turkey.",1,smoking cessation 
1063,"So, we'll do that so we'll-we'll talk about the hypnosis a little bit more, you know, you'll talk to your doc. Um, you'll do your research, you know, about programs and stuff, I'll give you any information I have and we'll take it from there. But it's sounding like the quit date might be coming up fairly-- like within the next two, three months.",1,smoking cessation 
1064,"I, uh, mean that's up to you.",1,smoking cessation 
1065,Yeah. Is it appealing the thought of quitting with a group at the same time?,1,smoking cessation 
1066,"Okay. So, that really sounds like something we can do.",1,smoking cessation 
1067,"So, that would be can- the Cancer Society. So, we can look into that.",1,smoking cessation

1102,"So she talked to you a little bit about it, but it sounds like you're kind of unsure exactly the details.",1,completion of community service
1103,Okay. So why don't you tell me what you remember from having your conversation with your case manager? What do you know so far about community service?,1,completion of community service

1106,-but you're a little fuzzy on the details.,1,completion of community service
1107,"Okay. Um, so maybe if it's okay with you, I can share with you some of, um, the requirements, maybe go over the details a little bit more.",1,completion of community service
1108,"Okay, great. Um, so with your community service I know you've got 25 hours left to do, um, so that does need to get done by the end of your probation, and your case manager is a really great resource to help you find a place where you can do it. So I know in the past some clients have done their community service at food pantries or shelters, or anywhere in the community that's not, you know, a family member or a friend. Um, the urban ecology center is a really great place. You can kind of work outside, work with younger kids. Do any of those options seem like a fit that you might be interested in?",1,completion of community service
1109,So that's something that you can work with your case manager on.,1,completion of community service
1110,"So, um, that's something you can absolutely ask her or quest- or me some questions about, but they'll be able to come and bring you some options-",1,completion of community service
1111,#NAME?,1,completion of community service
1112,"And that is something that we'd kinda like to see you do on your own, but if you're really feeling like you're struggling, those are phone calls that either you and I can make together or you and your case manager can make together.",1,completion of community service
1113,"Well, I mean, 24 hours in a weekend sounds to me like it might be a lot of time.",1,completion of community service
1114,I can- I can hear that you are really eager to just get it finished-,1,completion of community service
1115,"-and get it out of the way. Maybe I know in the past it's been helpful for some other clients to sit down and take a calendar and just mark out, okay, I'm gonna do five hours this day, I'm gonna do three hours this day, two hours of this day. Does that sound like something that might be helpful for you?",1,completion of community service
1116,What other questions do you have for me about community service?,1,completion of community service
1117,"So Tom, this infection is been pretty painful for you but we have antibiotics. If you take it faithfully for 10 days, I'm sure that your infection will be gone. Can you do that?",1,reducing drug use
1118,"And, uh, um, you do this how often?",1,reducing drug use
1119,So you're an occasional meth user. You don't use very often?,1,reducing drug use
1120,"Well, as I think you know, Methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. And the amount that you're using it-it puts you in a category that we consider a risky user. And that contrasts with someone who it says addicted, um, someone who's a heavy user but it's not in a healthy category because people who use Methamphetamine tend to run to a number of consequences. And actually one of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. Do you suppose that your STD might be associated with your Methamphetamine use?",1,reducing drug use
1121,Anything else happening with Methamphetamine in your life? Is it affecting you in any way?,1,reducing drug use
1122,"Yeah, you know, I'm concerned bout it too and I'd actually recommend that you stop using Methamphetamine altogether. And, um, there-there are a lot of reasons for this but that's-that's would be my recommendation.",1,reducing drug use
1123,"Well, if you were to, um, consider how ready you are to stop using Methamphetamine completely-",1,reducing drug use
1124,-with zero being not ready at all-,1,reducing drug use
1125,"-and 10 being ready, where would you put yourself?",1,reducing drug use
1126,Why not a one or a two?,1,reducing drug use
1127,Are there any other concerns that you have about Methamphetamine?,1,reducing drug use
1128,"Mm, so when I was first talking to you, I thought that you'd have a very, um, really not much interest in not stoping using Methamphetamine but it sounds like you have a number of reasons why you really would like to stop using Methamphetamine. And that is, um, that it might be cut with something else, um, you could get another ST- STD including HIV.",1,reducing drug use
1129,"Um, what do you think would make it easier for you to cut down or quit using Methamphetamine?",1,reducing drug use
1130,Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?,1,reducing drug use
1131,Does she-- Have you talked to her about your meth use?,1,reducing drug use
1132,"So on the one hand, it would be difficult to quit using Methamphetamine because there are so many positives that you get from using it. But on the other, there are reasons why you want to quit using methamphetamine.",1,reducing drug use
1133,And there's some things that you might be able to do that would make it easier to not use methamphetamine including talking to your sister and getting some support.,1,reducing drug use
1134,"Well, great. I recommend that you not use Methamphetamine at all but what you do is up to you.",1,reducing drug use
1135,"Mm. Okay. Alright. Well, um, I know a little about why you're here today-",1,reducing drug use
1136,"-um, but it's great to see you, and so maybe a good point to start with is, tell me why you're here.",1,reducing drug use
1137,And that's led you to being here today?,1,reducing drug use
1138,"Right. So it sounds like you thought there was something that, uh, that you needed to look at, something that was concerning you?",1,reducing drug use
1139,You're not sure that applies to you?,1,reducing drug use
1140,"I'm trying to understand you so far, something's concerning you and something's concerning your friends-",1,reducing drug use
1141,-but you're not sure whether it's- whether-- just how bad it is or- and you're just wanting to check that out?,1,reducing drug use
1142,"Because they care about you and-and you respect what they say, and you're wondering whether something about what they're saying may be right, but let's check that out a bit?",1,reducing drug use
1143,"Well, let's do some checking out.",1,reducing drug use
1144,"So tell me a little bit about what you're doing, what is- what is the concern that they are raising.",1,reducing drug use
1145,"Tell me a little bit about what now and again means, and-and-and how often.",1,reducing drug use
1146,"Is this- is this with, uh, with the drug?",1,reducing drug use
1147,This is meth you're talking about? A couple of times a week?,1,reducing drug use
1148,"Well, maybe, we c-- we can check that out to see whether-whether it's a lot or-- But maybe also importantly to-to discuss with you what the effects are and-and-and what your concerns are about it. But help me to understand a little bit more of what it's like for you. Tell me- tell me what are the things about your, uh, use of meth that you- that you've liked that you found good for you?",1,reducing drug use
1149,"So Auckland, coming to Auckland from Palmerston for you was-was like taking charge of something that you were going to look to make something different in your life?",1,reducing drug use
1150,Which you weren't aware of in Palmerston?,1,reducing drug use
1151,It sounds like you're ready to move up to something that was different.,1,reducing drug use
1152,And how does that feel for you now?,1,reducing drug use
1153,"So coming out, feeling-- being gay-",1,reducing drug use
1154,"-being part of a gay culture here in Auckland, is feeling good-",1,reducing drug use
1155,"And at the same time, it's-it's linked closely with the- with the drug scene with the meth scene for you?",1,reducing drug use
1156,And you're not experiencing where these two things are separate? They just seem to be together more often than not?,1,reducing drug use
1157,It just sounds like something's worrying you about that there's-there's a part link there but there's not a link and that-that maybe that the drugs is-is becoming a more important part in your life.,1,reducing drug use
1158,Tell me about those things you're noticing that you hadn't noticed before.,1,reducing drug use
1159,"So you're worried a little bit about it and you're going to find out more about it, but you're-you're not gonna take on this notion of being a headache or anything as yet—",1,reducing drug use
1160,"So tell me then, um, Ricky, what- what's the other side of the good things that-that using meth or doing some smoking does for you? Is there a downside to it? Are there problems that you're experiencing?",1,reducing drug use
1161,Quite a lot's changed over the last year from—,1,reducing drug use
1162,Sure. [chuckling] It's not a secure profession-,1,reducing drug use
1163,"-it's hard. But is-is there, I just wonder, is there a connection at all between the-the-the-the acting and the meth use in terms of the effect of the meth use on your- on your ability to get work?",1,reducing drug use
1164,The drug may have had an effect on that?,1,reducing drug use
1165,Right. And they got questions too-,1,reducing drug use
1166,You're beginning to-to think about those things and-and-and what effect they may have on you.,1,reducing drug use
1167,"What else? Are the-the-the-the problem of around the use of money, you know, the choices that you make around money, and the meth use has taken up quite a lot of the money-",1,reducing drug use
1168,"-over the last year and maybe also the effect on-on um, your job and being able-- maybe you're not auditioning as well as you might.",1,reducing drug use
1169,"Hmm. But Ricky, let me just check, 'cause I may got this wrong, just check with you that um, there are some friends that you've got who do use who are still concerned about you. Did I get that right from what you said earlier that-that those who are concerned about you and were part of this intervention some of them use.",1,reducing drug use
1170,And you-- So they have their concerns and-and you are beginning to-to ask questions of this use as well and-,1,reducing drug use
1171,-it's just that that we're gonna try and drill down a little more into just to pick up for you what-what you think might be going on and what you think might be some of the options for you.,1,reducing drug use
1172,"And we're g- we're gonna leave labels all that kind of stuff aside 'cause, you know, I'm picking up from you that that's not what that's about.",1,reducing drug use
1173,"I'm happy with that. What do you think will happen, what might happen if you can turn your-your uses- you're on now? What-what concerns do you have about not making any kind of change?",1,reducing drug use
1174,This is gonna be your career. This is the career-,1,reducing drug use
1175,"Mm-hmm. It's harder when you're trying to create your career, get that going. You gotta- you gotta be at your- at your top, top pitch.",1,reducing drug use
1176,"Yeah, and-and maybe the meth use is-is compromising that.",1,reducing drug use
1177,"Alright, so it's back to the money thing again which is-",1,reducing drug use
1178,"Let's just come back to another thing, uh, that we were talking about a little bit earlier, and it's around your meth use as well and-and-and with your gay friends, with gay lifestyle. And-and that sounds like you're saying that-that-that when you party, when you go into the clubs, when you're being with friends that the meth use is always there?",1,reducing drug use
1179,The-the availability of it is there.,1,reducing drug use
1180,"And everyone, most people are using.",1,reducing drug use
1181,And it might be hard to be part of that scene and not to be using drugs?,1,reducing drug use
1182,So there is a possibility that there are other parts of the scene that don't rely on drug use-,1,reducing drug use
1183,"So that might be something that we can look at but later if you're interested in is maybe what are some of those other parts of the gay scene, whose still party and party medley, but when meth is not a- is not a dominant-",1,reducing drug use
1184,"-factor in that partying, and we- where-where there are, uh, uh, uh, gay groups that support people who-who are not wanting to be-- they have a lifestyle that is heavily weighted to drug use. So there are some options there to look at some other ideas if you're interested and we might look at that, for you to think about-",1,reducing drug use
1185,"-to consider, so it's not about giving up anything, it's not about huge major changes, it's about how can I improve the situation.",1,reducing drug use
1186,It's what I'm hearing you saying bring-- be a little bit more in control of what's-what's going on for me.,1,reducing drug use
1187,So that I can pursue that plan.,1,reducing drug use
1188,What could be a- what could be a first step towards that?,1,reducing drug use
1189,"So that needs some thinking about, doesn't it?",1,reducing drug use
1190,"Yeah. Yeah. And there are things that have gotta work for you, so that-",1,reducing drug use
1191,"-that's your ideas on there which are really important. But again there are some options, that if you wanted to look at, you know, just to at least be able to know what they are.",1,reducing drug use
1192,Because there are clubs and there are groups and there are all kinds of things that meet through the week.,1,reducing drug use
1193,"And so, though they're not going to be necessarily like the party scene, they are other activities. Now I'm talking about gay groups and gay activities which are an option that-",1,reducing drug use
1194,"-you know, good to know about and-and-and maybe in-- within those options or something you might say, ""Oh yeah, I'd give that a go. Have a look.""",1,reducing drug use
1195,Okay. So right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life. It's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years.,1,smoking cessation
1196,It's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke then.,1,smoking cessation
1197,"Yeah. And your worry is that if you stop, you will end up gaining weight. So I'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping.",1,smoking cessation
1198,I'm wondering what else might be on that list.,1,smoking cessation
1199,Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. So added to the other list is the having to go through the withdrawal-,1,smoking cessation
1200,#NAME?,1,smoking cessation
1201,How are you doing today? I'm Bruce Berger.,1,diabetes management
1202,"I, uh, I'm a case manager with your health plan. I understand that you came in today to talk about your diabetes.",1,diabetes management
1203,"So you just- you just saw the doctor and, uh, you know, you sound like you just got blindsided, uh, with, uh, not only how, how frightening this seems that you have diabetes and that, uh, she-- you say she told you a whole lot of things that can happen with your eyes and circulation and all those kinds of things.",1,diabetes management
1204,"And so you're really kind of reeling right now from, uh, all of that. And you sound a little bit pretty, pretty scared actually.",1,diabetes management
1205,"So it sounds a lot like, uh, on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen, what worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control. Can't imagine doing all those things, so you almost feel like all that bad stuff's gonna happen.",1,diabetes management
1206,"Okay. And I-- And what I want to do is help you kind of break this up into some-some doable chunks so that we can get your blood sugar down. I, you know, on the one hand, your doctor is right, you know. Your blood sugar is very high and we do wanna get it down so that we don't have those consequences happen. Uh, and-and there are a number of things that you need to do in order to-to get your blood sugar down. Um, you know, on the other hand, we can take this a step at a time, so it's not so overwhelming.",1,diabetes management
1207,"Yeah. 'Cause it looks like you need to just take your medicine, uh, uh, once a day from-from the prescription. So that sounds doable right now.",1,diabetes management
1208,"Okay. The other things that need to be worked on over time certainly would be changing your eating habits, you know, to eat- eat healthier, uh, not necessarily less, but healthier. And the other thing would be getting, um, some more physical activity. And by the way, that doesn't mean going to a gym. That means things like more walking, maybe using stairs instead of an elevator or an escalator, stuff like that. Uh.",1,diabetes management
1209,Yeah. And that really is to give you feedback about how those other things are doing so that it keeps you on task.,1,diabetes management
1210,"So it helps you know that when you're taking your medicine, when you're changing your eating habits, that it's really having an impact on your blood sugar 'cause getting your blood sugar down is going to keep you from having all of those other problems. How does all this-- where does this leave you now right now in terms of how you're feeling?",1,diabetes management
1211,It sounds like you're very committed to that.,1,diabetes management
1212,Is it okay if we go over the form you had filled out? We give this out to everybody who comes in.,1,smoking cessation
1213,"All right. So here, it looks like you wrote that you drank alcohol on a few occasions in the last year, and you have used marijuana more often, 30 days in last year.",1,smoking cessation
1214,"Okay. When students and I talk about their substance use, the first thing I always say, I don't like to tell anyone what to do. That's not my job. Instead, I like to see if there's anything they would like to do, if anything, about their use. So what can you tell me about your marijuana use?",1,smoking cessation
1215,Do you vape anything else besides marijuana?,1,smoking cessation
1216,"We know marijuana has effects on the developing brain. For example, it can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder for you to remember things, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs. About one in six people who begin using marijuana as a teenager, later on, become addicted. So what do you think about all this information that I've shared?",1,smoking cessation
1217,How do you think it affects you?,1,smoking cessation
1218,How could you get in trouble at school?,1,smoking cessation
1219,"So when you think about these things, are there any things you would like to change about your marijuana use?",1,smoking cessation
1220,What would be the benefits of that?,1,smoking cessation
1221,Marijuana affects how well you play. What would be the other benefits for you?,1,smoking cessation
1222,"Okay. If I asked you to pick a number, 0 through 10, 0 meaning you're not very confident at all in meeting your goal, or 10 meaning you're very confident, what number would you pick?",1,smoking cessation
1223,How about this question? What might happen within a month that might make you want to vape?,1,smoking cessation
1224,What else could you do instead of vaping when you feel that way?,1,smoking cessation

1228,"Hi, Andrea, thanks for coming in.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1229,So I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here. So I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1230,"Basically, my job is to meet with all of the students. I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going, different behaviors that you might be engaging in, and thinking about any changes you might wanna make for your life if you decide that you do. It's not my job to change you. I couldn't even if I wanted to. That's not my role at all. It's really to help you think about, you know, how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1231,All right. So why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1232,Wow. You really are involved in music.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1233,"Very cool. I've always wanted to be good at music. [laughter] All right. So it sounds like you're in band and a-a few other musical ensembles, any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1234,Just kind of everyday sort of stuff?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1235,Okay. Tell me a little bit about your family.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1236,[laughs] Very fun. All right. And how are things going in school for you?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1237,"Okay, great, so you're doing well. What sorts of goals do you have for after college- oh, after high school?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1238,That's great. That's really exciting to think about that-,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1239,"-and sort of be looking forward to the future and those things. All right. Well, one thing I'm going to ask you about is, um, you know, different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life. Whether it's, you know, their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies, things like that. So here's the little sheet that goes through just some basic values that, um, might be more or less important to certain people.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1240,"Like belonging or sense of community. Again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. So, when you think about yourself, which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1241,"Respect, okay. Can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1242,"Okay, great. So sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of, um, uh, belonging, like you said.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1243,And sort of a-a sense of purpose in a way.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1244,And then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1245,"Not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you. Okay, that's great.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1246,"All right. Well, um, one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends. So what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1247,"Mm-hmm, and when you're hanging out with friends, is there ever alcohol involved?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1248,Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1249,"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And so when you go to parties, most of the time there's alcohol there?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1250,Okay. And how often do you think you would say you're drinking?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1251,Mm-hmm. So about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not. Can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1252,"So it really depends on what the activity is, whether or not alcohol is gonna be there?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1253,Okay. And do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus a night you're playing board games?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1254,Okay. So there's sort of pros and cons on both sides?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1255,Okay. What are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1256,"Okay. So sort of in the-the too much drinking or-or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1257,"You're trying to stay put, you're not driving. You're trying to stay with people that you trust. Um, but yet it sounds like there's still some-some things happening from time to time.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1258,Can you tell me a little bit about that?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1259,And how often do you think that happens?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1260,"-because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. And then, um, there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you, that sometimes you're stuck your-your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend who drunk too much. Okay. And the other not so good things about the alcohol?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1261,So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't need to see.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1262,"Got it. Okay. Um, all right. Well, you mentioned a couple of times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. Why did you make those decisions?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1263,"On the one hand, you- the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1264,"Right. And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1265,"Um, how do you think that the drinking fits in with that?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1266,Okay. So you're sort of looking for that balance-,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1267,#NAME?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1268,Okay. And what have you come up with at this point? Do you have sort of a-a limit that you stick to or are you--?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1269,Mm-hmm. Okay. And do you feel that that's working pretty well for you or do you sometimes exceed that limit or-or what do you think?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1270,-would like to make some adjustments-,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1271,#NAME?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1272,Uh-huh. So kind of combining you alls-,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1273,"-goals. Okay. So, you-you have a goal it sounds like, of actually cutting back on your drinking. How important is it to you to work on that goal and on a scale of one to ten, where one is not at all important and ten is it's the most important thing right now?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1274,Uh-huh. Why do you say six or seven rather than like a four?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1275,"Yeah, looking ahead, you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1276,"Okay. Well, how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1277,#NAME?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1278,"Oh, wow. Okay. Why do you say 10?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1279,"Okay. And so you mentioned the- you know, quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down. Um, have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1280,"So sort of, um, trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1281,-and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1282,Okay. Does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1283,Does that sound like something you'd like to do?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1284,"Okay. Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself, really ambitious goals of going to medical school and, you know, becoming a psychiatrist or, um, some-some other form of physician. Um, you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1285,"And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a-a lot of friends who you feel probably would be, uh, supportive, even if you cut down on alcohol and that, you know, there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health, um, your school performance, and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of-of, um, drinking too much.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1286,"Um, so yeah, you know, it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and-and interested in meeting again, I'd be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1287,All right. Great. So I'll-I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1288,"Hi, Dr. Martin. I heard you had a question for me. What did you want to talk about?",0,providing information on medicines
1289,"Yeah, I'm the pharmacist on duty. Citalopram, okay. It's an antidepressant and it comes in 10, 20, and 40-milligram strengths. It's excreted in the urine and it has a half-life of about 35 hours. For side effects, there are sexual side effects, heart side effects, and stomach side effects.",0,providing information on medicines
1290,"Oh, um, yeah, I think that should be fine.",0,providing information on medicines
1291,"All right. Well, do you have any specific questions?",1,providing information on medicines
1292,"Okay. Well, citalopram is an SSRI medication. Its indication is for depression and it's typically dosed as a 20-milligram tablet but it is available as 10, 20, and 40 milligrams. Any patients started on this medication should be monitored for improvement in symptoms in four to eight weeks.",1,providing information on medicines
1293,"If there are some side effects to this, it can include GI effects, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. But if you have a patient that suffers from any of those things, you can try either decreasing the dose or changing them to a different agent. Do you have any other questions?",1,providing information on medicines
1294,"Oh, that I'm not sure of. Um, can I get back to you later on this afternoon with that answer?",1,providing information on medicines
1295,"-so don't forget the nice car, and some kids, and be a- be a good dad-",1,reducing recidivism
1296,"Yeah. Okay. So, what I'm really interested in is how offending fits in with that picture, that dream.",1,reducing recidivism
1297,"Yeah, how doesn't it fit, Billy?",1,reducing recidivism
1298,"Yeah. It kinda messes up that dream, that picture?",1,reducing recidivism
1299,And we've talked about that idea of you getting a job and something to do with cars 'cause that's where your passion is.,1,reducing recidivism
1300,"Yeah? So, what have you been thinking, um, since we last met, about what you might do about getting that kind of job?",1,reducing recidivism
1301,"Okay, so you know some people?",1,reducing recidivism
1302,You've gone down that road of kind of going back to school in some ways and getting a tryout or-,1,reducing recidivism
1303,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, so what in particular? Like, if you could have whatever you wanted, in terms of that sort of work, what would you do?",1,reducing recidivism
1304,Okay. So-so what sort of things do you think you need to do to go down that path to get that qualification?,1,reducing recidivism
1305,"Okay. So, what sort of training did you-- did these people, that you've been talking about, what did they do?",1,reducing recidivism
1306,"Okay. So, it would be pretty easy. So, if it's pretty easy, what do you need to do next, Billy?",1,reducing recidivism
1307,"Okay. So, you actually went to the polytech—",1,reducing recidivism
1308,Tell me- tell me what happened when you say they-- like it didn't help you? What-what-what happened?,1,reducing recidivism
1309,"Okay. So, they gave you a horde of forms for a particular course?",1,reducing recidivism
1310,"Okay. So, you got the forms, took them- took them home?",1,reducing recidivism
1311,Mm-hmm. You said the forms were confusing?,1,reducing recidivism
1312,"Yeah. So, wondering what that's about, about not actually liking writing.",1,reducing recidivism
1313,People can't read-- People can't read your handwriting?,1,reducing recidivism
1314,"Okay. So, you need some help to fill out the forms?",1,reducing recidivism
1315,"Okay. All right, so what-what do you need to do, Billy, to actually get to that point where you can fill out a form and post it off?",1,reducing recidivism
1316,"Okay, so you feel like it would be embarrassing to ask Donna to give you some help-",1,reducing recidivism
1317,-because you feel that she might find out something about you that you're not quite sure you want her to find out?,1,reducing recidivism
1318,"Hmm. So, who else could you ask to help you?",1,reducing recidivism
1319,"Well, have you got the forms with you?",1,reducing recidivism
1320,"Okay. I'm wondering about-- because it sounds like this whole idea about filling out the forms, is getting in the way of this bigger dream that you've got which is around getting a qualification around something to do with cars-",1,reducing recidivism
1321,"-and getting on this road where you're staying out of trouble because you've got this, um, interest-",1,reducing recidivism
1322,#NAME?,1,reducing recidivism
1323,"So, the whole thing about going back to poly-- going back to school-",1,reducing recidivism
1324,"-going back to polytech is-- would-would require a really big change in the way which you're currently living, and you're not quite sure if you can do that.",1,reducing recidivism
1325,"Yeah. So, there's something here about your level of-- about how confident you are around writing or how unconfident you are, that sounds like it's getting in the way.",1,reducing recidivism
1326,"Well, this writing business. What's really getting in the way?",1,reducing recidivism
1327,"Well, I'm wondering, like-- it sounds like it's a thing that you're putting up as saying you can't do-",1,reducing recidivism
1328,-so I'm wondering where you are around your writing and you're reading?,1,reducing recidivism
1329,"Yeah. Well, I have to say, I think it's really obvious that you're not retarded.",1,reducing recidivism
1330,"Yeah, we are having a really good conversation here.",1,reducing recidivism
1331,"So, reading and writing is not a strong point for you.",1,reducing recidivism
1332,"So, how much reading and writing is involved in the course that you're gonna go on?",1,reducing recidivism
1333,"So, what'd it be like if you were more confident in your reading and writing? What'd that be like?",1,reducing recidivism
1334,"And, I guess that there will be manuals and stuff like that on-",1,reducing recidivism
1335,"-your course that, you know, to-- the hands-on stuff, it sounds like you're really confident around doing, but it's the more reading, writing, book, kind of, stuff that you are not so--",1,reducing recidivism
1336,Mm. Okay. So- so like before you get to here where you got this dream and there's some things that need to happen before that.,1,reducing recidivism
1337,"Yeah. So, mm, we need to think about what's the very first step.",1,reducing recidivism
1338,"Yeah, you know, I get it. Like, we've all been there. Okay. You know, I was in high school ones too, you know, I drank too. I get it. There's not a ton to do in this town a-and kids drink, but, you know, promise we have these rules-",0,reducing alcohol consumption; compliance with rules

1343,"You're a star player, who's going to pick on you?",0,reducing alcohol consumption; compliance with rules
1344,"All right. Well, yeah. So the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking. I can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook. You know, there-there are rules at this school and in my job, I have to enforce them. So, you know, like I said, I get it, you know-",0,reducing alcohol consumption; compliance with rules

1352,"Okay. So it's not something you wanna rely on, you don't see yourself continuing to use this. It's something that you'v found at least for the moment very helpful?",1,reducing drug use

1384,"Well, you know, I-I understand that pain is hard to work through but a lot of time when you're having rehab after a stroke, that pain is telling you that your muscles and joints are starting to work again.

1390,"Well, you know, Tai Chi is one of the best ways to get your balance back after you've had something like a stroke. And it's also really good for preventing falls. And if you wanna be home and you wanna be doing the things you wanna do and going for walks with your dog, it's very important to make sure that you don't fall 'cause that would cause more problems down the road.",1,more exercise / increasing activity
1391,So what do you think about Tai Chi? Is that something you think you might be able to try sometime?,1,more exercise / increasing activity

1394,"You could. You can talk to the instructor and that way you won't fall, you'll feel confident and you'll start to learn some of the moves. And then gradually over time, as you get a little bit better at doing the moves in a chair, you can start to stand up, use the chair to lean on, and then eventually, you'll be able to get to the point where you can do it on your own.",1,more exercise / increasing activity
1395,"You know, it cuts your risk of falls in half. It also helps to reduce pain although that's not a short-term benefit, you do have to stick with it for at least three to six months to start have it help reduce your pain. But it does have a number of things that I think would get you to your goals of being home and able to play with your dog and doing your own cooking and things like that.",1,more exercise / increasing activity
1396,I do Tai Chi. I do it three days a week and it's really helped my balance as well.,1,more exercise / increasing activity

1404,"Okay. Uh, would you mind if we talked a little bit about the chronic inhaler and the medicine that you're concerned about with, you know, the steroids because, you know, I certainly don't want her using a medicine that has steroids in it, like the ones that you're worried about for athletes. Uh, can we talk about that just a little bit?",1,asthma management
1405,"If-if I can draw an analogy-- Again, even though this medicine is in the same family as those big broad-broad family. If I could draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are in the same family of fruits, you know, and obviously, grape is much smaller than a watermelon. And if you eat one grape, you'd be fine. If you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you very sick. If we look at the grape as the medicine your daughter's taking, again, it's in the same broad family, the amount of drug that your daughter is getting is very small. Uh, and not only that it's not an anabolic steroid, even though it's in the same big family. And what this drug does is actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And-and it doesn't even get absorbed into the body. It only goes to her lungs. And as I said, I wouldn't want your daughter taking a medication that could have the impact of those anabolic steroids. This is really safe for your daughter to use. So what-what are your thoughts about considering having her using this?",1,asthma management
1406,"Yeah, def-definitely would not. I mean, probably you saw the name corticosteroid and thought, ""uh-oh.""",1,asthma management
1407,"You know. And so-- yeah, and that- and that does concern people. But I do want to reassure you that this is medication that only goes to her lungs, and won't get in her body and they're not the same kind of drugs as the ones you're worried about.",1,asthma management
1408,Do you mind if I talk to you a little bit about what your daughter's lungs are like when she's having these inflammations and needing to go to the emergency room?,1,asthma management
1409,And so this chronic inhaler can really prevent that from happening. Okay? Which is why it's so important to use it.,1,asthma management
1410,"The other thing I was going to tell you is that, unfortunately, uh, even though you are smoking outside and keeping the smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes, because her lungs are so sensitive, can also affect her lungs and cause her to have a reaction. Now, something I'd like you to think about is that, if you use the chronic inhaler every day, she may not be sensitive to the smoke on your clothes, but she still maybe because her lungs are just very different than ours. Um, honestly, I'd love to see you quit smoking for you too because, you know, as you know, it's not real good for you.",1,asthma management
1411,"It-it-it-- Yeah. It may not- it may not when she uses the chronic inhaler, uh, but you'll need to keep an eye on that. Obviously, it would be- what would be best if it didn't get on your clothes, or you quit smoking.",1,asthma management
1412,"Very hard. It's very relaxing, and-",1,asthma management
1413,"Uh, again, if you get to the point sometime down the road where you're willing to quit for both you and her, uh, we'd be glad to help you do that. Because you're right it is- it's not an easy thing to do.",1,asthma management
1414,"So it sounds like right now where we are, is you're willing to-to have her use the chronic inhaler-",1,asthma management
1415,"-to try to get the inflammation down, so she doesn't need to go to the emergency room and do whatever you can at this point to keep the smoke off your clothes. And I think you're gonna see big changes in terms of, uh, her not needing to go to the emergency room, and you probably won't need to use the rescue inhaler hardly at all.",1,asthma management
1416,"Yeah, because you'll get that inflammation down.",1,asthma management
1417,Yeah. So we'll go ahead and get both of those prescriptions ready.,1,asthma management
1418,"Use the chronic inhaler every day, keep the rescue inhaler around if she needs it. Uh, and let's see how that works.",1,asthma management
1419,So you saw yourself putting something that was important to you at risk.,1,recognising success
1420,"Here you are actually, three months on, three long months as you say, um, and things have been going really well, Uh, you even get a bit of—",1,recognising success
1421,"Yeah. Well, and then you get the kind of, I don't know if it felt like a green light or a yellow, it went from red to cautionary, you could see your kids, and that was something that was really what you were working for.",1,recognising success
1422,"Jean, it's good to see you again.",1,smoking cessation
1423,"So, what's been different since the last time we talked a week ago?",1,smoking cessation
1424,"So, you've been able to cut down by two or three cigarettes? That's amazing. I mean, given how much you were smoking.",1,smoking cessation
1425,"So, you were able to keep the, uh, the journal?",1,smoking cessation
1426,"You-- Sounds like you did that, and that allowed you to really focus on the time [unintelligible 00:00:57] delaying your cigarettes. So-so that's gone well. So, what are the things that are not going as well as you'd liked?",1,smoking cessation
1427,"Okay. So, these automatic cigarettes, when you're socializing and you're-- you have time on your hands, really, are the problems that you're facing-",1,smoking cessation
1428,"-uh, and that you've noticed are more difficult than the others?",1,smoking cessation
1429,"Okay. So, from now to the next time you come back and see me, what is it that you'd like to-to work on?",1,smoking cessation
1430,"Okay, so you can continue with that.",1,smoking cessation
1431,You said five cigarettes this time.,1,smoking cessation
1432,And any thoughts about what concretely you could do to make that happen?,1,smoking cessation
1433,"So, given what you're-you're attempting to do, when would it be good for you to come back and talk about this?",1,smoking cessation
1434,"Good. So, we'll see you in a week.",1,smoking cessation
1435,Did you like how your parents raised you?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1436,Tell me about how your parents raised you?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1437,Tell me about how you've been feeling?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1438,"Mm, what's that like for you?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1439,So you're feeling uncomfortable with changes in your body?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1440,Why do you think it makes you so hesitant to call?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1441,"Mm. So some of your feelings, uh, of being overwhelmed or about the logistics of the appointment, and some of it is you just don't like medical appointments and medical people?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1442,How can I help you with these things?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1443,"Sure, we can do that together.",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1444,Would you like to answer some questions and kind of do a self-evaluation about how you're feeling around alcohol and the contraception?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1445,"You'd say an eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1446,Okay. So that gives you a good reason not to drink. Okay. Anything else?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1447,So you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink below risk levels?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1448,"Now let's look at your self-evaluation of your birth control. So now we're doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control. So on a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep from getting pregnant?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1449,"An eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you- that you can use effective birth control?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1450,Probably a six. Okay. So you're pretty confident that you can do it. And why are you a six and not a two or three?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1451,"Very good. So it looks like, um, you're using a good method of birth control, you're just not able to use it effectively. And you've linked it back here to the drinking. So would you like to develop a plan around your alcohol use at this-- today?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1452,"Good to see you here. I see on your file that you're, uh, [unintelligible 00:01:18].",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1453,What part of the [unintelligible 00:01:22] are you from?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1454,Right down the bottom? Down Bluff?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1455,"Oh, are they? So you were born down there and-",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1456,Country boy. Been up in Christchurch how long?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1457,"Just your own whānau here. [unintelligible 00:01:51]. Well, Rick, I'm sort of, uh, interested in that, you know, you and I are gonna been doing some work together for a while. I'm sort of wondering what sort of thoughts you'd be having on your way here today.",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1458,"Okay. I see you've had a bit of experience with, uh, coming to prevention services.",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1459,What's that been like for you in the past?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1460,Okay. Similar sort of offending in the past that's brought you back again this time?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1461,"One of the, um, things that I've learned over the years, Rick, is that a lot of guys get to the doors out there and don't come inside and, um, you've come inside. What does that tell me about you?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1462,Yeah. So they're really important to you?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1463,Yeah. And do you have your kids with you full-time or-,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1464,"What would you really like to happen in terms of, uh, you and your children?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1465,"So coming along to see me and you and I are doing some work together, then you're going on to do a program, how important is that gonna be for you and your children?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1466,"Mm-hmm. If I was to put it on a scale of say 1 to 100, 1 being not really important, 100 being really, really important, whereabouts on that scale would you you be?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1467,"Yeah. What do you think it'd be like for your kids if they were sitting here now and they heard you say that this was really, really important to you and to them? That you gave this program 100%. Well, then what might that be like for them to hear that?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1468,Good. Anybody else in your family that would be really proud of-- that you're taking these steps?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1469,Yeah. Your is mum still down south?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1470,Yeah. Does she know that you're here today?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1471,So how might it be for her if she knew that you're talking like this today? That-- 'Cause it sounds to me like you're really serious this time making some changes.,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1472,So do you think doing this program and completing this program this time would be a good place to start?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1473,"Yeah. So you and I are going to be doing a little bit of work together then. And, um, and sometimes it-it can get quite tough. And I'm just wondering before we go any further, when the going gets tough, a lot of guys bail out. I'm just wondering are you one of those guys?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1474,"Good. One of the other things we're really conscious of with is, um, sometimes we do this work in isolation from others. And one of the things we want to ask people is about who they're going to be accountable to. I'm thinking like with your children, uh, your mom and other people that maybe you're interacting with. Who-who else in your life do you think would be supportive of you, and who would you need to let them know that you're actually going through this sort of program?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1475,What was-- what was your partner's name?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1476,Okay. What do you think it might be like for you to explore that with them?,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1477,"Any other family members that, uh, live close that, uh, you think would be supportive?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1478,"Okay. The reason why I'm asking this, Rick, is just, um, you know, part of, um, uh, being responsible is turning up and doing the program.",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1479,"The other aspect of that is kind of like who we're going to be accountable to while we're doing the program. So one of the- one of the challenges, one of the riddle I'm going to put in front of you is like who else can we get involved to support you while you're going through this?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1480,"Okay. So as we're gonna do this work together and go through this, uh, this program, one of the things we-we don't want to do is fall into the same trough we did last time. So I-I just want to leave that with you to think about next time we come together. There may be two or three other people that you think of that can be really supportive, that we-we need to let know that you're [unintelligible 00:10:50] each gonna make these changes and this time, you're serious about it. So let your mother and, uh, and, um, your partner, how might that happen? How does that sound to you?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1481,"Rick, I get a sense that you're kind of padding this walk a little bit on your own at the moment. Would that be true?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1482,"Your family is down south. I mean,who-who-who else do you think would be really interested in sup-supporting you, rowing with you if you like on this journey?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1483,"Yeah. How would it be for your mum, do you think, if you were to tell her that this is something that you're-- is really important for you and that you know that this time you really need to do this for her and for the family? What-what might that be like for her to hear?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1484,"Brothers and sisters, that, uh, would also be very supportive if you were to make this journey?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1485,"And, um, I’m just trying to imagine what do you think your mom would want to say to you if she was sitting here with us now and she heard you talking about this?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1486,"Mm. What do you think she might want for you, like upon her for your children?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1487,I’m getting a strong sense that's what you want as well.,1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1488,"So, in terms of having the confidence to do this with the support of your whānau and ours, where do you think your confidence level might be now?",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1489,"That's a huge move up the scale, isn't it? So getting your family on board, getting your whānau on board is going to be really important for us.",1,taking medicine / following medical procedure
1490,Hi Billy. How are you doing?,1,reducing recidivism
1491,"Yeah. Hey, it's good to see you here and good to see you here on time. Yeah, it's really good to see a good start to the-- to your probation time with us here is to see you being here on time. So how did you get here today?",1,reducing recidivism
1492,"Yeah, caught the bus to-to that-- to the stop outside the office?",1,reducing recidivism
1493,"Just was feeling like, ""Ugh, it's gonna be a waste of my time coming here.""",1,reducing recidivism
1494,Mmh. So how come you thought it was going to be a waste of your time? What was it based on?,1,reducing recidivism
1495,Okay. So you're hoping that it was gonna help you and it didn't. That was-- ended up feeling like a waste of your time.,1,reducing recidivism
1496,Mm. So it sounds you're worried that it's gonna be a waste of your time this time too.,1,reducing recidivism
1497,"Mm, okay. So what sort of things do you think made it a waste of time last time?",1,reducing recidivism
1498,"Okay, the probation officer we're talking about here?",1,reducing recidivism
1499,"Okay, so actually having someone listen to you and hear about what you're saying is important to you?",1,reducing recidivism
1500,You're right. I don't know what it's like to be you and what I'm getting a sense of is that it's actually important that the person sitting opposite you in this role needs to understand what it's like to be you. Is that right?,1,reducing recidivism
1501,"Yeah, okay. So I guess the invitation for both of us really over the next few months of, um, on the sentence is for us to get an understanding about what it's like to be you.",1,reducing recidivism
1502,"Yeah, okay. So in terms of the things that have brought you here, in terms of the things that have got you into trouble and got you into offending, I'm wondering how interested you are in, um, really getting an understanding of it. So one or zero is like, ""Ugh, not interested at all.""",1,reducing recidivism
1503,"100 is like, ""I'm totally interested and-and getting it nailed and sorted and, you know, getting on the straight and narrow."" Where would you be on that scale?",1,reducing recidivism
1504,All right. So it's kind of silly stuff that's getting you into trouble.,1,reducing recidivism
1505,"Is that what I'm hearing? Yeah. So in terms of dealing with it, where-where would you be, do you reckon? How interested would you be in dealing with that stuff?",1,reducing recidivism
1506,"Okay, so you don't wanna be back here. You don't wanna be sitting here and-",1,reducing recidivism
1507,#NAME?,1,reducing recidivism
1508,Okay. So where would you be do you think?,1,reducing recidivism
1509,"Zero being, ""Argh, not interested at all,"" 100 being totally into it.",1,reducing recidivism
1510,So I know that you're kind of 25% interested-,1,reducing recidivism
1511,-and really thinking about what's got you into trouble and hence something about what gets you into trouble.,1,reducing recidivism
1512,You wanna stop getting into trouble.,1,reducing recidivism
1513,"Okay, so getting into trouble and, uh, getting caught and-and we see [unintelligible 00:05:36] does about luck and this time being unlucky.",1,reducing recidivism
1514,"Yes, tell me a bit more about that, Billy? Kind of give me the [unintelligible 00:05:46] the cops have got it on for you?",1,reducing recidivism
1515,"Mm, so it feels like you always seemed singled out and, um, end up being unlucky.",1,reducing recidivism
1516,"Okay, so you get singled out and that's what, um, means that you end up getting-- having to go to court and get sentenced and end on probation.",1,reducing recidivism
1517,"Yeah. So I'm wondering, um, if there are things that you think, ""Well, I can see that that's got me into trouble,"" and, you know, kind of cops aside, things that might have got you into-into trouble.",1,reducing recidivism
1518,"Mm-hmm, okay. So some stuff that you can think, ""Oh yeah, I had, you know, I did some stuff that yeah, got me into trouble.""",1,reducing recidivism
1519,"It wasn't perhaps about the police singling you out. So those little things, well, you think, ""Mm, yeah, maybe-maybe if I'd done something differently, I wouldn't have ended up in trouble."" How interested are you in thinking about those things and-",1,reducing recidivism
1520,#NAME?,1,reducing recidivism
1521,"Okay, so you don't wanna end up kind of being in prison again 'cause you've done some time inside. Yeah, and you don't wanna end up going back to prison, yeah. So-so that's one thing about wanting to make a difference and the way things are at the moment, yeah.",1,reducing recidivism
1522,"Cool. What else would, um, would help to kind of keep you out of trouble do you think?",1,reducing recidivism
1523,#NAME?,1,reducing recidivism
1524,"Okay, so you don't have any cash and that's the stuff that causes you to do the small stuff-",1,reducing recidivism
1525,"Okay, so if you had a job, you feel pretty confident, but if you don't have a job, your confidence is much-is much lower, is that-",1,reducing recidivism
1526,"Okay, so if you don't have a job you reckon, um, you'll probably gonna keep on offending.",1,reducing recidivism
1527,"Okay, so part of this, what's going on is you also getting bored?",1,reducing recidivism
1528,"Mmh. Yeah, say something more about that. It sounds really interesting about you knowing that you get bored really easily.",1,reducing recidivism
1529,"Yeah, what-what makes you say that?",1,reducing recidivism
1530,"Okay, so you wanna kind of get some action, don't wanna sit around-",1,reducing recidivism
1531,"-all the time. But one of the things I'm noticing, we've been going here for a wee while now talking and, uh, I haven't noticed any lack of attention.",1,reducing recidivism
1532,"Mmh, and when we might be talking about something that doesn't interest you, what would I notice?",1,reducing recidivism
1533,"Okay. All right, so-so one of the challenges is for us to be talking about things that interest you. Yeah.",1,reducing recidivism
1534,"Um, and also maybe get to the point where things are different in your life Where you're not getting into trouble and things feel a bit more sorted in your life.",1,reducing recidivism
1535,"Hi, Billy, how are you doing? It's good to see you again.",1,reducing recidivism
1536,Okay. So you're keeping out of trouble.,1,reducing recidivism
1537,"Yeah, so how'd you get here this time? Like 'cause other times you got the bus? What-what did you do this time?",1,reducing recidivism
1538,Oh yeah. Who's- who's Donna? You haven't mentioned Donna before.,1,reducing recidivism
1539,Oh okay. Tell us something about Donna.,1,reducing recidivism
1540,"Hmm, you get along with her really well.",1,reducing recidivism
1541,Oh okay. So someone who's both a friend and a girlfriend?,1,reducing recidivism
1542,"Hmm, yeah. It's really special when you find someone who can be both a friend and girlfriend, eh.",1,reducing recidivism
1543,Yeah. You were made to say you're lucky.,1,reducing recidivism
1544,"Hmm. Okay, so she dropped you off here today.",1,reducing recidivism
1545,So what does she think about you coming here?,1,reducing recidivism
1546,She doesn't want to get you in trouble and I heard you say earlier on that you've been keeping out of trouble.,1,reducing recidivism
1547,So what sort of things have you been doing together?,1,reducing recidivism
1548,Okay. Gives you something to do. So we talked like back on that first time we met about how you reckon you've got a short attention span and like things to like to be doing things.,1,reducing recidivism
1549,"So you're watching movies with her, you're hanging out?",1,reducing recidivism
1550,"Yeah, and keeping-keeping out of trouble.",1,reducing recidivism
1551,"Mm-hmm. So when you say mostly, it kind of leaves a little bit of room for there to be some trouble.",1,reducing recidivism
1552,"Okay, so she's- she's got a job.",1,reducing recidivism
1553,Mm-hmm. So kind of 9:00 to 5:00 sort of job.,1,reducing recidivism
1554,Mm-hmm. So you two get to spend Friday together and the weekend.,1,reducing recidivism

1556,"Mm-hmm. So what sort of mischief are we talking about here, Billy?",1,reducing recidivism
1557,"Mm-hmm. Okay, so you're kind of skating on the edges of getting in trouble again.",1,reducing recidivism
1558,Mm-hmm. Okay. So I'm wondering how much of what you do on Fridays you tell Donna.,1,reducing recidivism
1559,- I'm wondering if she knows that.,1,reducing recidivism
1560,"Well, what-what are her hopes for you, Billy?",1,reducing recidivism

1563,"Okay. So, you'd be with Donna, and you'd have a house, and you settle down, maybe have some kids?",1,reducing recidivism
1564,"Yes? So, it sounds like having children is something you've thought about? Um.",1,reducing recidivism
1565,Mm-hmm. She'd be a good mum?,1,reducing recidivism
1566,Yeah? What sort of dad do you reckon you'd be?,1,reducing recidivism
1567,Mm-hmm. That's something- that's something that's come up before with-with-- when we've been talking about that idea about not liking being bossed around.,1,reducing recidivism

1674,"Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by?",1,smoking cessation
1675,"Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing.",1,smoking cessation
1676,"Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right?",1,smoking cessation
1677,Okay. Is there anything I missed?,1,smoking cessation
1678,So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette.,1,smoking cessation

1680,Is there anything else that's not good about smoking for you?,1,smoking cessation
1681,"So-so let me ask you this, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing to do, and 1 would be the least important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking?",1,smoking cessation
1682,"Let me ask another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least confident, how confident are you that you will be able to quit?",1,smoking cessation
1683,"Okay. Now, help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit.",1,smoking cessation
1684,Okay. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to build that confidence to about 45%?,1,smoking cessation
1685,"So if you got help, that would help you say that you went from 40% to 45%.",1,smoking cessation
1686,"Okay. So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but as the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act. And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first small step. What are your thoughts about that?",1,smoking cessation
1687,That's correct. And writing it down helps that process.,1,smoking cessation
1688,"Okay. And I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to the next appointment, it could be something we could discuss. Okay. Anything else?",1,smoking cessation

I-I know that if you-you know, and if you want to keep Sarah out of the emergency room, uh, I-I just wish you'd heed what I'm saying. She needs to use that chronic inhaler every day to get her- to get her asthma under control, and the smoke on your clothes and the smoking flares her asthma up. So she really needs to use that chronic inhaler, and you really need to think about quitting smoking.",0,asthma management

You feel like a burden to mom, that stresses you out. That makes you sad. You see how much she struggles, but also on the same hand, we see how much you've been trying and how much you've been trying to help out by trying to go to school. We know your attendance is good.

1872,"Well, you filled out this survey for us today, which was great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to review a couple of things on here. I noticed that you said that you drink two to three times a week, drink three or four drinks at a time when you do drink, and weekly, um, have more drinks than that. So six or more drinks, it says on here.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1873,"Okay, okay. I just wanted to let you know, I'm a little bit concerned about your level of drinking. We know that excessive drinking can make problems worse or can actually cause health problems at times, and I was just wondering if you thought about the connection between your drinking and things like the anxiety and the insomnia that you came in with today?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1874,"Well, you're not alone, a lot of people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you fall asleep faster, but it has what's called this rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up, may, might wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and have a hard time falling back asleep.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1875,"Mm-hmm. Well, I just wanted to just show you this little chart here. For your age as a male, you're drinking more than those at a low-risk level. Um, the low-risk level for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. And, in this case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. And you're right, you're not drinking as much as some people out there. The way you answered our questions here, you're actually falling in the high-risk category, the risky or hazardous category, category two.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1876,"That's why it's helpful to look at this and give some perspective. On a scale of 1-10, what is your readiness to change, 1 being I don't want to change at all, and 10 is I really want to change?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1877,"Well, that's great. That's halfway there. What kept you from just giving it a one or two, something lower?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1878,"Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, that's a good place to start. So, I heard you say your health is important, and you're getting ready to run a marathon, so you wanna be able to do what you can to make that successful. And you also were a little bit surprised that you fell into this risky or hazardous category.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1879,"Okay. So, based on all that information, what are you willing to think about doing to change right now?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1880,"Mm-hmm. So, what would that look like for you?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1881,"Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you were to look at this little form here and figure out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your goal?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
1882,"Okay. So that's an improvement. So you're headed in the right direction. I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week. But it's an improvement, and it's a great place to start, and I really commend you for your willingness to take a look at this and try to make some improvements.",1,reducing alcohol consumption

1888,"So do you- do you, um, put out there about the felony conviction before you even go for the interview?",1,reducing recidivism
1889,Seems like it's a done deal.,1,reducing recidivism
1890,"Yeah, 'cause you're-you're, especially with going back to school and having done all that footwork and stuff. I mean, you really have something to offer somebody.",1,reducing recidivism

1893,What do you think would happen if you did that?,1,reducing recidivism
1894,"Would that be, um, what would they be like versus getting through this great interview, knowing you're-you're good for the job and all that kind of stuff, and then they boot you out?",1,reducing recidivism
1895,"Mm-hmm. It's, uh, I mean the lesser of two evils is that what we're getting at-",1,reducing recidivism
1896,"Right. If that's a deal-breaker and you both know it from the very beginning, I'm wondering if then really the interview is really something else. I mean, whether they get the job would truly be based on the interview and not-not your criminal record.",1,reducing recidivism
1897,"Mm-hmm, you didn't go to college for that.",1,reducing recidivism
1898,"Mm-hmm. So, what have you looked into about, um, you know, advocacy in that area or expungement or anything like that?",1,reducing recidivism
1899,"I-I didn't know that. So I, you know, I know a little bit about it, um, and not, yeah. So that's-that's very interesting. Oh, what about advocacy groups?",1,reducing recidivism
1900,Mm-hmm. So you're-you're Middle Eastern. So you wonder-- I-I bet you've had experiences where you really have experienced some absolute racism and prejudice because of that.,1,reducing recidivism

1909,"Uh, yeah, it does. Uh, I am yet to- it-it seems to me just in this time we've been talking together that you, um, um, do have a sense that a lot of it has to do-do with, uh, timing, luck, who you know, and being, are you able to have that conversation where you know that you can sell yourself and your skills and, um, and your competencies and the fact that you've overcome so many things like, um, substance abuse problem and, uh, have been, you know, uh, a good upstanding citizen all this time.

1946,Yeah. Yeah. So you've got some good reasons to try to cut back a little bit.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
1947,Yeah. And it sounds like you're willing to maybe try not going to the bar quite as much and maybe drinking a little bit less when you go to the bar.,1,reducing alcohol consumption

First of all, tell me, you were telling me on that phone that you wanted to die. But, um, did you-- Was this a suicide attempt or do you think it was just-just a cutting?

Um, it was really created for parents and families, just like yours, folks who have a lower income and fewer resources, but Head Start really prepares your child both socially and intellectually for going to school.

I just want to ask you one thing though. Have you thought about secondhand smoke and the dangers of that and how that might be impacting your son?",1,taking steps towards getting help with day-care
2027,"Oh, okay, good. You know, I can tell you really have your son's best interest at heart here. You know, just from our conversation today, I can tell you're a really good mom. Um, let's reflect back on what we've discussed here so far. Now, we've got a couple of good options between the neighbor and Head Start programs for childcare.

2039,Yeah. Is that something you'd be interested in?,1,smoking cessation

2083,"So, Chris, I wanted to talk to you. Um, you know, you're one of our star athletes. I really value you as a team player. As Athletic Director, one of my jobs is to, kind of, keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best. And something came up this weekend. I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2084,"So, here you are. You're an honors student. You're a star athlete. You've, kind of, been doing everything you've been told for all these years, and maybe last month sometime, you started getting more involved in the party scene.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2085,And it was fun at first. But now you're already noticing some consequences.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
2086,It's really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
2087,"Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though your mom got mad at you, you're having decreased focus, you're, kind of, not doing so well in school, maybe-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2088,"Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying, it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2089,Your mom is really important to you.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
2090,"How important is it to you to make, uh, an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2091,How confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or-or even cut down or quit?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
2092,O-on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all 10 is completely what number would you give.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
2093,Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
2094,"All right, what do you think's a realistic goal for you then?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2095,"So your goal is kind of to do not drink at all or if you are at a party, uh, a maximum of one at the very most.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2096,"Yeah. Chris, I really appreciate you talking with me about this. I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is and, you know, like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you. So I'm glad we were able to talk about this. It really seems like you have a good plan going forward, you know, really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there's alcohol, making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum. It sounds like something that will work for you.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2097,"Thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes. I understand you don't have very much time, but I really appreciate you stopping by.",1,smoking cessation
2098,"Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things that-that you're also, uh, a bit concerned about, um, but as you said earlier, not-not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately.",1,smoking cessation
2099,"So Sandra, what's good about smoking? What do you like about it?",1,smoking cessation
2100,What else? Tell me what else is good about it.,1,smoking cessation
2101,Okay. So is there anything else that you like about it?,1,smoking cessation
2102,"So let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it, and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out.",1,smoking cessation
2103,"So it sounds like it's a way to relax. It's a way to socialize with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke.",1,smoking cessation
2104,"You also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight, and that smoking after meals is pleasurable, that it's something that would be really hard to give up.",1,smoking cessation
2105,"I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. It's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture, for you, some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking?",1,smoking cessation
2106,So I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things?,1,smoking cessation
2107,"And again, thanks for your honesty in talking about this. I appreciate that this is a- this is a tough topic. This is a-a hard behavior to think about giving up. Um, I guess one thing that- one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that, you know, on the one hand, you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority, it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter-",1,smoking cessation
2108,"-um, and on the other hand, I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief, socializing, and it's something you can't imagine ever changing. How do those two things fit together?",1,smoking cessation
2109,"So what would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important, that raised it up in the list of priorities for you?",1,smoking cessation
2110,"So, it's-it's not so much that you don't wanna quit in a way, it's almost, ""How could I do it that would work for me?""",1,smoking cessation
2111,Okay. I appreciate. We've- we've probably used up the time that we have. I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this. Is that something that would be helpful?,1,smoking cessation
2112,"[chuckles] Not necessarily the-the most exciting thing for you to do, but I appreciate you are willing to do that. Can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week? I promise it's not too time-consuming. Um, we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing, who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do, and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change, why you would even consider quitting smoking. And then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about, as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke. Is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days?",1,smoking cessation
2113,"So thanks for coming in, Sandra. We'll see you next week.",1,smoking cessation
2114,"In summary, the Minnesota State Mankato security report states that you were stopped on stadium road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence and you're transported to detox. Plus the report lists your age as 20. Dylan, what is the accuracy of the report? And can you share with me some details leading up to the incident?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2115,"You decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed at how the Vikings were playing. And when your roommate couldn't give you a ride home, you decided to drive yourself home. Did I get that right?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2116,"Yeah, I understand that your intention was to have a good time while watching the game with your friends. You didn't think about what could go wrong when you drank alcohol underage because you were at your friend's house and not a big party and you made an effort to be safe by finding a ride home.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2117,"Dylan, you told me what brought you here today, what do you think the problem really is?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2118,"Sounds like you attribute your current situation to bad luck. If that's what you believe and you don't attempt to make any change in your behavior, what consequences might result?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2119,Yeah. What would you be willing to do to prevent going to detox again and getting suspended?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
2120,"On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you'll be able to follow through with that plan with 10 being very confident?",1,reducing alcohol consumption

2122,College is all about making choices. Can you tell me about your beliefs and values that influenced your decision-making and how do those beliefs and values align with the decisions you plan to make about drinking?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
2123,Thanks for coming in for participating today. Your sanction will involve being placed on university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar that will cost $150.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
2124,"Okay, so why don't you have a rinse, David. How are you feeling?",0,smoking cessation
2125,"Good. Here, take a look, see what you think. And that feeling-",0,smoking cessation
2126,"-and the color's okay? You know, there is quite a lot of staining so, um, I'm just wondering about, um, some concerns about smoking.",0,smoking cessation
2127,"-coffee, tea. Yeah, you've heard this before, I'm sure.",0,smoking cessation
2128,"Mm-hmm. So, you know, the smoking is going to be related not just to some of the other negative consequences. You know, physically, it affects dental caries, dental cavities-",0,smoking cessation
2129,".No, it-- but David, it's not a waste. Research shows that people take on average about seven tries before they quit smoking, so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting, so--",0,smoking cessation
2130,"Well, I don't think I'm giving you a lecture, that's certainly not what I meant. I--",0,smoking cessation
2131,"Well, there's-there's a reason that [crosstalk] people are concerned.",0,smoking cessation

2135,"Yeah, I appreciate it. So, um, uh, your mom had given me a call and said that, um, um, there were some problems with kids kinda given you problems at school and being mean and things like that, and, uh, that's a hurtful thing.",1,overcoming issues at school
2136,"That's a- that's a lot of school to, yeah, and, you know--",1,overcoming issues at school
2137,People like to make up stories.,1,overcoming issues at school
2138,"So it's, uh, so when you were talking about like nagging on, tell me a little bit more about, can you give me an example of what you mean?",1,overcoming issues at school
2139,"And-and what happens when you don't leave it be, what usually happens?",1,overcoming issues at school
2140,"Okay, so and then what-what's it like for you after that, once you get spanked in the principal's office?",1,overcoming issues at school
2141,That's pretty cool that you did that.,1,overcoming issues at school
2142,"You should be proud of yourself, and how did you do that?",1,overcoming issues at school
2143,"Uh, that says a lot about you and your mom's relationship though that you can kind of put yourself in her head and think about how she would feel about it.",1,overcoming issues at school
2144,"You know what I mean? It's pretty cool, not everybody can do that, so. So you could kind of put yourself ahead, uh, it's almost like watching a movie ahead-",1,overcoming issues at school
2145,"That's the worst, the silent treatment.",1,overcoming issues at school
2146,"Yeah, so, um, so but that worked for you, where you just let it go, you thought about your mom, you like what we would call like, you channeled to your mom, you know, and, uh, channeling mom, and then, um, you were able to walk away, and you were proud of yourself and nothing bad happened.",1,overcoming issues at school
2147,"Yeah, so- and so when you- when somebody else told you that they or people said you that you're an easy target, um.",1,overcoming issues at school

2160,Okay. And so how else do you identify who your friends are that you can really trust who have your back?,1,overcoming issues at school
2161,"Okay. Well, that makes a lot of sense that people-- it goes both ways.",1,overcoming issues at school
2162,"You know. And, um-- So and for you, friends that, um, kind of, um, give you the attention that you'd like to have. Texting you-",1,overcoming issues at school

2165,Mm-hmm. Wh-what don't you like about her?,1,overcoming issues at school
2166,"Okay. So she sounds like she's, um--",1,overcoming issues at school
2167,She's not worth your time. So what would it be like for you to really just spend time with the friends that you know are really--,1,overcoming issues at school
2168,Good. That's really good. Yeah. And if-if you need like some extra support from them--,1,overcoming issues at school
2169,"Right, and what kind of things do you ask from them?",1,overcoming issues at school
2170,"'Cause they can do that. They can- they can kinda give you some, uh, information like, uh, um-- they can give some accurate information, um, and back up your story versus the other person's story.",1,overcoming issues at school
2171,"So, okay. So we're-- You know what? Um, it sounds like you actually have some pretty good ideas about, um, how to handle this, and yet kids are-- I know kids-- actually, adults can be really mean too. But, um, I know in high school, i-it's really bad.",1,overcoming issues at school
2172,"So I'm wondering if, um, uh, if-if you wanted to, we could get together again and continue to talk 'cause you-you've got some good ideas already. And I'm very open that if you wanted to bring any of your good friends in, that that would also be totally cool too.",1,overcoming issues at school
2173,"Well, I would want this session though to be for you though, Molly.",1,overcoming issues at school
2174,"I mean I'm willing to see her too, you know.",1,overcoming issues at school
2175,It sounds like she really needs-- she'd like someone to listen to her.,1,overcoming issues at school
2176,"Yeah. And, um, so you'd be willing to come back and talk about it then? Okay. All right. And I just wanna let you know that I think that you're, um, really doing a good job of-of, uh, dealing with how hard it is to be in high school, 'cause it is hard.",1,overcoming issues at school
2177,"Yeah. And it is hard, and-and I-I think it gets better. My experience was it got a little better. The freshman and sophomore year, you know.",1,overcoming issues at school
2178,"But, um, anyway, I think you are hanging in there beautifully, and I love hearing that you're involved in swimming and some other things 'cause they must help connect you up with some pretty-- I would hope-",1,overcoming issues at school
2179,"Hello, nice to meet you again. And, uh, and what seems to be the-the problem or what-what prompted you to come along?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2180,Okay. Wh-What makes you say that it's gotten worse?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
2181,"Okay, okay, so you've noticed over, I guess, uh, the last six months in particular since you decided, you know what? I'm going to take a risk and-a-and go out to try to meet a-a-a pot-potential partner again that it's with an increase in drinking.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2182,"Sure, sure. So you're noticing that the drinking at the moment is a way of perhaps calming the nerves?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2183,"That's interesting isn't it? You-- 'cause you kind of mentioned it there, like, you know, on one side of the coin, um, it helps calm the nerves to get yourself get out there and-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2184,"-talk to guys at the same time, on the other side it's not working you're finding. And i-i-it results in hangovers or?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2185,"Okay, and so I guess, you know, what would you like to do given the circumstances?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2186,"Okay, okay, so, uh, sounds like you really want to stop drinking, particularly during the weekdays?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2187,"Right, because you're noticing it's having a negative impact on what you're eating.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2188,"No, I get it. Yeah. I mean, you know, it sounds like it's, it is helpful to a degree for you when you go out because it makes you feel a little bit more calm to talk to-to guys is that right?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2189,"Yeah, yeah. So, you've got, you know, some benefits there then, you know. The social element, hanging with friends and-and going out together is something which is-is quite enjoyable. So, it's not a case of removing it completely but it’s a case of, ""Okay, I’m noticing this is impacting on me more than what I’d like to."" Yeah. Yeah, okay.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2190,Has there been times in the past where you’ve tried to cut back on drinking?,1,reducing alcohol consumption
2191,"Oh, this is the first time anything like this has come up?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2192,"Okay, yeah. Well, it’s great that you’re able to identify, you know, what’s going on at the moment and you've-- not only know that, you almost picked up on a bit of a pattern too you're in-",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2193,"-as to why you’re-you're drinking. In terms of looking at cutting back on-on drinking, you know, on a scale of 0 to 100 and 100, uh, meaning it’s tremendously important for you and 0 not important at all. How important is it for you to cut back on the drinking?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2194,"Okay, yeah yeah sure, you're already taking a huge step forward in many ways by coming along to-to start talking about it.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2195,"Um, I guess 80 is quite high, what makes you say an 80 over say 50?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2196,"Okay, yes, so you’ve got this real sense of, ""I've gotta do something.""",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2197,"So, at the moment, it's been a case of the last six months, this is a pattern that you’ve been noticing more and more, um, a sign that it has had negative impacts on your lifestyle which you’re not happy with and you are in you're in a position where, you know what? I wanna do something about it.",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2198,"Okay, I mean what do you think that next step is?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2199,-so it just doesn’t go crazy.,1,reducing alcohol consumption
2200,"Okay, how does that sound like a first step goal for you?",1,reducing alcohol consumption
2201,"Okay. Right. Uh, to be honest, you know, looking there, it just looks like one of those viruses that are going around at the moment that are causing these sore throats. So, uh, I think that we should just perhaps go for a bit of paracetamol and, uh, some fluids and let nature sort it out.",0,diagnosis
2202,"Well, I mean, I'm sorry we're a bit late, but you know that's the general practice, isn't it? You know, sometimes these things happen. Um, but it doesn't alter the fact that you do just have a virus, uh, and they are very common. And the nice thing is that it will get better with paracetamol and fluids, and the paracetamol will help the pain. Um, with giving it to the kids, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that. It's unlikely they'll get it, but I can't guarantee it.",0,diagnosis
2203,"Uh, well- well, not really. Uh, you need to self-certify in your first seven days off sick so if you're going to take some time off, just take some paracetamol, lots of fluids, get a self-certified note, uh, in to your employer, and put sore throat there.",0,diagnosis
2204,"Oh, I'm sorry. But, you know, if you have just got a sore throat, then there's not much I can do about that. It's just, you know, something that we all get from time to time. Perhaps, what you really need to do is, uh, you know, just take some paracetamol and get some fluids.",0,diagnosis
2205,"Okay, that's pretty unlikely with sore throat. I think that's so, you know, a little bit of grand staging there.",0,diagnosis
2206,Thanks for coming in. Tell me what's been happening since we last spoke.,1,managing life
2207,It's gonna keep happening that you have to turn down opportunities.,1,managing life
2208,"Mm-hmm, okay. Well, tell me, um, on a scale from one to 10, how important is it for you to get a job?",1,managing life
2209,You have to provide for your children.,1,managing life
2210,"So, it sounds like, you know, the childcare issue has been getting in the way, and so finding something that would work for you would be really helpful.",1,managing life
2211,Okay. What is it that you- what is it that you want?,1,managing life
2212,"Yeah. Yeah. So, if you had- if you had consistent work, it would change your life in a lot of ways.",1,managing life
2213,Mm-hmm. It would provide the income that you need and you wouldn't worry so much.,1,managing life
2214,Right. So every day you know where you're going.,1,managing life
2215,"Okay. And you know, what's- what's happening for the- for the day, for the week.",1,managing life
2216,Right. Yeah. Because you're- you're the kind of parent that wants to make sure your kids are doing well.,1,managing life
2217,"Yeah. Um, so tell me, what would it take to get you to like a five in confidence, to feel a little bit more confident about getting work?",1,managing life
2218,Yeah. Because you definitely need to go to an interview in order to get the job.,1,managing life
2219,"So having taken care of that part, having some reliable childcare would definitely help.",1,managing life
2220,What else would get you to a five?,1,managing life
2221,"Yeah, so if you had something on your resume that was around education training, maybe a certificate of some kind of a field that you're interested in, that you would feel proud of yourself.",1,managing life
2222,"Mm-hmm. Okay. What-- do you have any ideas as to what fields you might be interested in getting some more education, more training?",1,managing life
2223,Like what's going to be fastest.,1,managing life
2224,"Okay, and so if- if you were, it sounds like if you were going to do something you'd wanna to do something really quickly like a short- a short certificate.",1,managing life
2225,But that would be steady and pays well?,1,managing life
2226,"Okay, so specifically getting some computer skills will help?",1,managing life
2227,"Mm-hmm. Okay. So whatever and so far it sounds like getting a job is really important right now and you really need the money and you really need to take care of your children and it sounds like you have some ideas as to how you could get to these interviews for one, and then once you're there at the interview, feeling more confident about your skills, um, getting some child-- reliable child care certainly sounds very important.",1,managing life
2228,"Um, as well as maybe doing some sort of certificate or getting some classes and training in computers?",1,managing life
2229,"So what would you like to do next, you think?",1,managing life
2230,"Well, I'm glad we figured that out and I think you'll feel better over the next few days.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
2231,"Well, since I have you here and we still have a few minutes left, I'd like to bring up another topic. I noticed that your blood pressure and your weight have been climbing a bit over the past few years. We haven't really had time to talk about this much before and I may be able to offer some useful strategies. Would it be okay if we discussed weight and health for a few minutes?",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
2232,I know how you feel. Managing weight can be frustrating. Maybe we can just start trying to figure it out together and I'll be here to help you through the challenges.,1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
2233,"Yeah, that's certainly understandable. We both know that there's a lot that plays into weight management, but there's no need to figure it all out today, especially since things are so busy for you right now. Maybe we could put our heads together and think about something small that fits reasonably into your life and then we can take further steps when you're ready.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
2234,"Well, let's see. One of the things that's involved in managing weight and health is being active. Physical activity benefits the whole body. It's healthy for our joints, our stress levels, and especially for weight management. Perhaps we could talk about some ways of adding activity that fit into your life.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
2235,Me too. Walking is great exercise.,1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
2236,"Actually, even just a few minutes of walking is really healthy and worthwhile, and then when you have time to do even more, that's great. Walking is also great because you can do it anywhere, it doesn't need to be at the gym.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
2237,"Well, dancing is a great exercise, especially because it's fun.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
2238,"Oh, that's great to hear that your family is so supportive. And I bet there's a dance class somewhere around where you live or maybe even a dance fitness class at the gym.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
2239,Would you like to do some research on this and give it a shot?,1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
2240,"Well, small steps can go a long way. So, even things like taking the stairs instead of the elevator every once in a while or parking just a bit further from the door when you go to a store can be ways to increase movement in your day.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
2241,How about we start there and let's plan to follow up in a few weeks so we can see how it's going and then maybe talk about some other strategies that might help.,1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss
2242,"Not necessarily. What we eat is certainly important for weight and health, but just like we did today, we can talk about some small steps that can fit into your life, and especially ones that you feel good about.",1,more exercise / increasing activity; weight loss

2251,He's got a lot to do.,1,diabetes management
2252,So how are you feel in your head-,1,diabetes management
2253,"And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?",1,diabetes management
2254,"So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-",1,diabetes management
2255,#NAME?,1,diabetes management
2256,"-when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.",1,diabetes management
2257,"A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot",1,diabetes management
2258,Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?,1,diabetes management
2259,Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.,1,diabetes management
2260,"That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.",1,diabetes management
2261,Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.,1,diabetes management
2262,"Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.",1,diabetes management
2263,That makes a bit of sense.,1,diabetes management
2264,"Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.",1,diabetes management
2265,"And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.",1,diabetes management
2266,"So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.",1,diabetes management
2267,"You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.",1,diabetes management
2268,That's a good way to think.,1,diabetes management
2269,Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.,1,diabetes management
2270,"And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.",1,diabetes management
2271,"Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?",1,diabetes management
2272,Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.,1,diabetes management
2273,"Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.",1,diabetes management
2274,"From your perspective, things are going well?",1,diabetes management
2275,"Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.",1,diabetes management
2276,So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--,1,diabetes management
2277,And you know that's a bit too-,1,diabetes management
2278,"And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?",1,diabetes management
2279,"So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.",1,diabetes management
2280,Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?,1,diabetes management
2281,"And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.",1,diabetes management
2282,Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.,1,diabetes management
2283,"Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?",1,diabetes management
2284,So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-,1,diabetes management
2285,-when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?,1,diabetes management
2286,You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--,1,diabetes management
2287,You still run and have a cigarette?,1,diabetes management
2288,"Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.",1,diabetes management
2289,"But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?",1,diabetes management
2290,"Okay, so you meant to reduce.",1,diabetes management
2291,You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.,1,diabetes management
2292,"When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.",1,diabetes management
2293,So you've made our decision to do that?,1,diabetes management
2294,"Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?",1,diabetes management
2295,But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?,1,diabetes management
2296,"You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.",1,diabetes management
2297,"Cholesterol good, your weight is good.",1,diabetes management
2298,"And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. The tire is good, oil good.",1,diabetes management
2299,"Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.",1,diabetes management
2300,And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.,1,diabetes management
2301,"So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-",1,diabetes management
2302,A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.,1,diabetes management
2303,Feel like you need to. Yeah.,1,diabetes management
2304,"The test, is the test, and experience, yeah.",1,diabetes management
2305,"I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.",1,diabetes management
2306,"It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.",1,diabetes management
2307,So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-,1,diabetes management
2308,"Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?",1,diabetes management
2309,"Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.",1,diabetes management
2310,"Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-",1,diabetes management
2311,#NAME?,1,diabetes management
2312,"So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-",1,diabetes management
2313,"Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.",1,diabetes management
2314,"You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.",1,diabetes management
2315,"So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.",1,diabetes management
2316,"So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.",1,diabetes management
2317,I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.,1,diabetes management
2318,"So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.",1,diabetes management
2319,"Not huge changes, but some little things you could do.",1,diabetes management
2320,"Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?",1,diabetes management
2321,Yeah? You like the social aspect?,1,diabetes management
2322,"No, no, I get that. I get that.",1,diabetes management
2323,"So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?",1,diabetes management
2324,And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.,1,diabetes management
2325,And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.,1,diabetes management
2326,That sounds like a great plan.,1,diabetes management
2327,"I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting a little bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit.",1,diabetes management
2328,"Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?",1,diabetes management
2329,What's to lose? What's to gain?,1,diabetes management
2330,"So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.",1,diabetes management
2331,"So you've got to work these things on your mind. You know, the-- And workout where's the place to start.",1,diabetes management
2332,"So it's been a bit of a-a bit of a shock, but now you kinda reflect on it.",1,diabetes management
2333,"-bit of a shake that I needed, you know, just sort of remind me. I might feel okay. I might-- From my perspective, your perspective, you're thinking, ""Well, what's the problem? Everything's fine.""",1,diabetes management
2334,"But now you seem to be thinking looking and thinking, ""Maybe things weren't, or aren't, as good as I thought they were.""",1,diabetes management
2335,"Yeah, I sense that. I sense that in you that you're--",1,diabetes management
2336,Quite invigorated with the idea of--,1,diabetes management
2337,Making some of these changes. Yeah.,1,diabetes management
2338,So think about when you were-- This-this is an interesting question to see what you think. You were- you were a coach. You-- Maybe you'll be a coach again.,1,diabetes management
2339,"What would you say if you were talking to yourself, if you like, you know, if you were the coach saying, ""Right--""",1,diabetes management
2340,"Yeah, what-what would you be saying?",1,diabetes management
2341,"And, I suppose, our own personalized a little bit like that, there's lots of different aspects that need to be tweaked.",1,diabetes management
2342,"Modified and looked at, to get the best out of ourselves, to get the best out of the opportunities we have.",1,diabetes management
2343,"Some good things I'm- some things I'm good at and there are some other aspects we think, ""Well--""",1,diabetes management
2344,It's not about giving up your personality or-,1,diabetes management
2345,"It's just tweaking things. Just fine-tuning a few areas and being a bit more aw-aware of one aspect of your life a bit more, like the food choices or whatever. Well, Mike, I-I've really enjoyed listening to your perspective, and your story a little bit, and it's helped me a lot to get an idea about where you're coming from, and a little bit about who you are, and what's happened in your past. And-and we've also talked a bit about what's going to happen next. And you've come up with some great ideas. What I hear you saying is that, you know, before all this, before you met the GP, things are going fine.Well, as you would of-- As, you know, as you'd seen it, you were just doing your thing, and getting on working, and being busy, and being successful, and then suddenly this diagnosis, this doctor tells you that you've got a problem.",1,diabetes management
2346,"It comes along to me and talk today a bit about how you felt about that. Initially, it can be quite a bit of a-bit of a shock. It didn't quite fit with how you saw things.",1,diabetes management
2347,"And as we've been talking, I'm hearing you're saying that maybe if you look back to where you were before you went to the doctor, things weren't quite that right, maybe. Things weren't as good as you thought they were.",1,diabetes management
2348,What you're kind of thinking about what those might.,1,diabetes management
2349,#NAME?,1,diabetes management
2350,"Yeah. So, we've run out of time but I also want to ask you a final question, where to from here, what's next?",1,diabetes management
2351,And you also mentioned you'll perhaps go and- back and see the doctor and just give him a bit of an update as to-,1,diabetes management
2352,You are gonna make a start?,1,diabetes management
2353,"It is. Well, just to help you, because there's probably a lot of other questions you might have, other questions that might come up after this session.",1,diabetes management
2354,"-before we go, I'd like to just-just give you a lot of- some information that might help-help you.",1,diabetes management
2355,"Not too much, just some stuff that might just give you a little bit of background information on-",1,diabetes management
2356,-some of the things that have-,1,diabetes management
2357,"-around type- around Type II diabetes and some,-",1,diabetes management
2358,"Um, and I'd like to us- for us to meet again, so to catch up with you and make an appointment before you leave. Just to see how things are going and-",1,diabetes management
2359,-see what sort of little changes you've managed to make. I'd be really [unintelligible 00:37:07]-,1,diabetes management
2360,It's really up to you. Probably a little bit sooner would be good.,1,diabetes management
2361,Because you don't know the timeline?,1,diabetes management
2362,"Yeah. So-so you've got this new group of friends and-and, um, you-you actually kind of like where you're at with things right now. And your mom was going through your stuff and found your stash, and it's just turned into a, you know, all of this.",1,unidentifiable
2363,"And, uh, sounds like you're-you're pretty upset with your mom for-for doing that?",1,unidentifiable
2364,"Right. It's like your private place and, you know, it's-- that's-- it's your stuff.",1,unidentifiable
2365,Yeah. So why should she go through yours?,1,unidentifiable
2366,"Okay, I finished the exam. I have some good news and I have some not-so-good news. Looks like you don't have any cavities, so that's the good news.",0,smoking cessation
2367,"Okay. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really definitely white-colored and there's little red spots. And you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth, but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called nicotinic stomatitis. And this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes, are you smoking a pipe or cigars? Or is there something else that could be contributing to this? Because I don't know what else might be causing it.",0,smoking cessation
2368,"Okay, so I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, people think they're okay. Those are really bad for you. Did you know that?",0,smoking cessation
2369,"Right. They're still cigars and they're still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarette, so it's really important.",0,smoking cessation
2370,"What do you mean, maybe? I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth, you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit.",0,smoking cessation
2371,"What's there to think about? [chuckles] You said it's not that something you do all that often, and there's all these negative side effects, there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in.",0,smoking cessation
2372,"Okay, well, that's a good start, but cutting back isn't going to do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from- from being at risk for these other diseases. But as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger.",0,smoking cessation
2373,"Well, I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, this is something that I'm gonna continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change.",0,smoking cessation
2374,"Okay. So what ideas do you have, Natalie for, um, getting started in adding more physical activity?",1,more exercise / increasing activity
2375,Great. It sounds like there are a lot of activities that you do like-,1,more exercise / increasing activity
2376,"-and I'm hearing a theme of climate control, [chuckles] being important to you and you've already been researching gyms.",1,more exercise / increasing activity
2377,Right. Okay. So you're looking for some-something that's reasonably priced-,1,more exercise / increasing activity
2378,-and that you don't have to sign a contract and you're right. It's hard to tell what the cost is just from looking on the website.,1,more exercise / increasing activity
2379,"-um, element of it. What seems like a logical next step based on-- You've kind of already gotten the ball rolling. What feels like a logical next step?",1,more exercise / increasing activity
2380,Okay. So maybe visiting a gym and then also choosing a non-gym activity to sort of get started when the weather's permitting.,1,more exercise / increasing activity
2381,"I have one, um, idea that is jumping into my mind as you're talking. Is it okay if I share that?",1,more exercise / increasing activity
2382,"I'm wondering about the price of the YMCA compared to other gyms. Uh, is that one that you have an interest in or have looked at already?",1,more exercise / increasing activity
2383,"Yes. And honestly, I don't either. [chuckles] I just suspect that it might be slightly cheaper than some of the more private gyms.",1,more exercise / increasing activity
2384,So something to look into if you're interested.,1,more exercise / increasing activity
2385,And they-- I would suspect they'd be less sales pitch-oriented than a private gym. So it might be a safe place to explore first-,1,more exercise / increasing activity
2386,"Okay. Great. So, um, in addition to exploring the gym possibility, what sounds like a logical next step for a non-gym activity to get started, some small goal that feels doable, um, and you have control over because it doesn't require the perfect weather-",1,more exercise / increasing activity
2387,"That's great. It's important to know this about yourself, what works, and what doesn't work, and what you feel motivated to do. So, it sounds like we sort of have two small goals right now. One is to maybe visit the YMCA and-and find out how much that costs-",1,more exercise / increasing activity
2388,#NAME?,1,more exercise / increasing activity
2389,Okay. So you'd like to kind of get motivated with- with the use of an app and that might help you get started.,1,more exercise / increasing activity
2390,"Okay, fantastic. So, on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being really confident, I can research a gym and go for one walk, and zero being not at all confident, how are you feeling about these two small goals?",1,more exercise / increasing activity
2391,Wonderful. Are there any other barriers that would be helpful to sort of talk through?,1,more exercise / increasing activity
2392,"Okay. So being creative with your indoor space is a-is a solution you've come up with yourself for - f there just aren't any good days, nice days outside.",1,more exercise / increasing activity
2393,"Great. Well, you came in today feeling pretty discouraged about your energy levels and your mood and, um, feeling lousy about your body in general. And, uh, today we've talked about a small-small step to get started and you're hoping to experience some mood boost and some energy as you get rolling here. Um, how are you feeling about today's session?",1,more exercise / increasing activity
2394,"So, what you're saying is you've had a rough night?",1,unidentifiable
2395,"So, she needed to eat every three hours last night and that was really frustrating for you?",1,unidentifiable

2407,"Hello, Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 called in by Dr. Ferris today.

2408,Okay. What did the doctor tell you cholesterol statin is for?,0,taking medicine / following medical procedure

2410,All right. Do you have any children in your home?,0,taking medicine / following medical procedure
2411,"Okay. Well, then that sounds like a perfect location for you. Medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture. What did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?",0,taking medicine / following medical procedure
2412,"All right. Well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. So check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. So if you use grapefruit juice every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication.",0,taking medicine / following medical procedure

2422,"All right. Well, this medication is usually well tolerated, which means that it doesn't have very many side effects, but you might experience some muscle aches or pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also, this medication can interact with over-the-counter medicines or even other medications. So before you start something new, you should check with either Dr. Ferris or myself. And lastly, this medication can interact with grapefruit juice. So while you're taking this medicine, I would avoid grapefruit juice.",0,taking medicine / following medical procedure
2423,"So, where you said you'd like to start, Sal, is talking about your asthma and specifically about your dog and how one is affecting the other.",1,asthma management
2424,"Hmm. So, what- can you let me know or-or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse?",1,asthma management
2425,Okay. And that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern?,1,asthma management
2426,Hmm. Yeah. And I-I can see that you've already worked hard to make some changes. You've almost quit smoking.,1,asthma management
2427,You're just down to your last couple of cigarettes-,1,asthma management
2428,"So, your house is totally smoke-free.",1,asthma management
2429,#NAME?,1,asthma management
2430,"So now almost like that's not good enough, like now you have to, now it's the dog and now-",1,asthma management
2431,"-what's next. Right. Okay. So, I mean, there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse.",1,asthma management
2432,"-but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar, you know, when he's in the house or-or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him, what happens with your asthma symptoms?",1,asthma management
2433,"Hmm. So, it doesn't make total sense to you that-that it's all Oscar's fault and that-",1,asthma management

2436,"Hmm. Yeah. And-and in the end, you know, whatever you- whatever you do, about Oscar, about your asthma, about all the other things that we talked about on that agenda-setting worksheet, I mean, you are in the driver's seat solid. It really is your choice.",1,asthma management
2437,"There's a lot of decisions and a lot of change with your wife, with the new baby.",1,asthma management
2438,"And now thinking about, looking after your health and wanting to be healthy for your wife and your baby.",1,asthma management
2439,-and it's not one that you're gonna make in a hurry.,1,asthma management
2440,"Yeah. He wasn't too happy with the exam, was he Hailey?",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2441,"Um, well the good news is that the exam's over and I don't think Jake has pneumonia. What I actually think he has is a cold. So there are some things you could do to manage his symptoms. Would you be interested in knowing?",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2442,"What I would recommend is that you avoid over-the-counter cold remedies, keep him away from any friends or family who may have the flu, keep him well hydrated, um, avoid excessive dust, and avoid smoking. And at least that last one's easy because you are an ex-smoker now.",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2443,"All right, Well, first I'd just like to commend you for your honesty and that's really helpful information that you shared with me. Thank you for letting me know that you're smoking again and-and, um, I also appreciate the fact you're taking so many measures to protect your son from secondhand smoke. Can I give you some advice on how you could protect him, even the- even further?",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2444,"So, my sense is that you're smoking and you're minimizing hi-his exposure by not smoking in the same room and smoking near windows. Is that-",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2445,"So what I would recommend then, is to move your smoking outside completely. As a smoker, the ideal situation for a smoker in the house is if their home can be made smoke-free and the smoking is moved entirely outside, especially while he's experiencing this cold.",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2446,"Okay, so, what I'm hearing you say is that, it sounds like a feasible short-term plan, not ideal and not comfortable because what you really enjoy is that cigarette with a glass of wine, kicking back up on the sofa and chilling out perhaps while you're watching TV. And to maintain that long-term outside smoking outside in Canadian winters where it's cold and snowy, not realistic.",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2447,"So, on the one hand I'm hearing smoking and drinking at night as a way to chill out but at the same time the next day, you're not feeling so great.",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2448,Would it be helpful to give you some information on low risk drinking guidelines?,1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2449,"Okay. Well, Hailey, what they suggest is that women don't have more than one to two standard drinks a day or a total of nine standard drinks in a week. How does that fit for you?",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2450,"So, it sounds like you'd be open to reducing as a way to still enjoy the wine but perhaps alleviate the way you feel in the morning, some of the hangover effects that sounds like you're experiencing.",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2451,"Okay. So, you're gonna try to reduce the drinking, not sure about the smoking, what the plan is but I think we did agree upon earlier that you would move it outside, at least while he's sick?",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2452,"That's okay. All right and, um, I guess we'll see you next week for Jake's six-month checkup. Is there anything else we could talk about that might be helpful?",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2453,"Sure, of course, Hailey a-and again I really appreciate your openness and honesty about letting me know what's going on with, you know, the stress levels and coping and drinking. I just had a thought that there's also a good mom's group, we run out of our center. So if you'd like a referral to that or some information, I'd be happy to give you and while you think about it, if you want to, um, talk about this further with one of my colleagues, I'd be happy to make you an appointment.",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2454,"Thanks, Hailey. We'll see you next week.",1,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2455,"Huh, you feel like you dodged the bullet.",1,birth control
2456,It feels like it was like two days was a year?,1,birth control
2457,So what would have happened if you found out that you were pregnant?,1,birth control
2458,Would you be open to kind of exploring the idea of birth control and family planning?,1,birth control
2459,"Now, it's a discussion you don't really wanna have.",1,birth control
2460,"At the same time, you have some concerns about the possibility of getting pregnant.",1,birth control
2461,"So you found some ways to prevent pregnancy up until-- well, maybe, um, you've been pretty fortunate, and then there is also some times where you feel like, ""Oh, no. What if I didn't dodge the bullet?""",1,birth control
2462,"Okay. So, you've been able to kind of avoid any kind of consequences, and right now, you're not feeling that talking about birth control is something on your-your list.",1,birth control
2463,Okay. I respect that. Thanks though for coming in to see me today.,1,birth control
2464,And I'm glad that this appointment was a positive one for you.,1,birth control
2465,"No, wait a minute. That has everything to do with what we're talking about. I can't believe at the end of this appointment, you're just slipping in the fact that you've resumed smoking again. That's very, very important information for me to know. And I'd like to spend some time talking about it now.",0,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2466,"Come on, Hailey. You're here because you thought he had pneumonia. You're telling me that Jake can't breathe, you're concerned about his breathing. And then you just slip in the fact that you're smoking cigarettes and you think there's no relationship? Do I really need to review all the risks of smoking in front of your-your child or exposing him to secondhand smoke not to mention the risks that you're posing to yourself and your own health?",0,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2467,And let's talk some more about wine. You keep throwing wine into the conversation. It sounds like it's become a significant part of your daily routine. How much are you drinking?,0,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2468,"I'm trying not to be hard on you, Hailey, but I've got to tell you as a position, it's a very big deal. Your drinking and your tobacco use are red flags for me and they need to stop immediately. So we've already talked about your plan for smoking. You're going home. You're throwing out your cigarettes. You're putting on the patches. What's the plan for the alcohol?",0,smoking cessation; reducing alcohol consumption
2469,Good morning. It's really nice that you've come along to see me to talk about stopping smoking.,0,smoking cessation
2470,"What have you got in mind, what do you want from us?",0,smoking cessation
2471,"Absolutely, we're in the right place for that.",0,smoking cessation
2472,"Okay. Well, just remind me again why it is you want to stop.",0,smoking cessation
2473,"Oh, good, and so feeling under pressure here.",0,smoking cessation
2474,And so that-that can't feel a little uncomfortable being by yourself. So that sounds like one of the reasons you have to quit is it's a little getting smelly and it's getting embarrassing.,0,smoking cessation
2475,Okay. So we're talking about spending £50 a week-,0,smoking cessation
2476,#NAME?,0,smoking cessation
2477,Do you think that's enough to make you say goodbye to cigarettes?,0,smoking cessation
2478,"Generally, it works well if you find a time when you're not under a huge amount of other stresses and strains.",0,smoking cessation
2479,What are the main reasons why you actually smoke? What do you enjoy most about it?,0,smoking cessation
2480,Yeah. And what is your favorite cigarette of the day?,0,smoking cessation
2481,"Okay, so the end of the day-",0,smoking cessation
2482,"Okay. So after you've had the quit date, what do you think you might do when it it's the first day at work and it's time to go home if you're not gonna have a cigarette?",0,smoking cessation
2483,Have you managed to stop smoking in the past?,0,smoking cessation
2484,Okay. And what got you back?,0,smoking cessation
2485,"-so it took you back into it. All right. Let me just make sure I've understood what's going on here. You really want to stop smoking because you're kind of the last guy in your group still smoking, it costs a lot of money, and you don't really like the smell.",0,smoking cessation
2486,What you'd like to do is stop and you'd like to sort of like choose a time to quit when it's going to be there's not as much stress around as possible. When do you think would be a good time for you to choose to be your quit date?,0,smoking cessation
2487,"So Monday morning after the party will be a good day, and that's next week. Okay. Now, one of the things that we do in the pharmacy is recommend that you use medication to help you. You know this increases your chance of success and it makes it more likely that can manage any cravings that come along. A lot of people like using nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats like patches, gum, you've probably seen people using any of these products. And other options are tablets which you can get from the GP.",0,smoking cessation
2488,"So, yeah, again-- Um, so have you something in mind that you might like to use to help you through managing the cravings?",0,smoking cessation
2489,"Okay. So a patch is something you've already seen, and-",0,smoking cessation
2490,"-and, again, I'll get some out and I'll show you what they look like. This course of medication lasts for 10 to 12 weeks. And we strongly recommend that people stay on the whole course of medication and that that gives you the best chance of success. Stopping smoking is not easy but it's possible and with the type of support that we offer here in the pharmacy, you absolutely make your chance of success four times greater than trying on your own, so, that's why it's really good that you've come to see me. Now, what you said is you really want to do it and that next week sounds like a good day for you to start because the party is over and done with.",0,smoking cessation
2491,And that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I'm looking to stop happening to you.,0,smoking cessation
2492,"So, I would strongly recommend that you have the patch. I'll talk to you about how to use that and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation are coming up, particularly in that first week.",0,smoking cessation
2493,"So, you're happy with the date for [unintelligible 00:06:16]?",0,smoking cessation
2494,"Actually, I'm not going to do that because you're the boss. It's up to you what you want to do with you about your own health.",1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2495,You don't seem too happy about that.,1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2496,"Well, there's a lot of things you can do yourself that will improve the situation as well. So what we can do today is wee up some of those things, smoking, diet, exercise, weight, loss, all those kinds of things. So we're just gonna start and see how you feel as we go.",1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2497,"Well, it's very much up to you, you're the boss of your own life. Where would you like to start?",1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2498,"Well, I could give you my opinion. Um, and I can give you lots of information, but I think you know the score pretty well. And I think you'd know what I would say.",1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2499,"Absolutely. Spot on. So stopping smoking would have a huge impact, that would have a big impact very early on. Losing weight would also have a big impact because that would help with your blood pressure, your cholesterol, and also lower your diabetes risk. So what-what'd you think about those things? Uh,",1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2500,"It’s really tough. It's hard to know where to start, isn't it?",1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2501,How important is it for you then to lose weight?,1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2502,So can it be in there for your-your family's important to you?,1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2503,Yeah. So w-where do you think you can start with that?,1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2504,What's kind of the first thing you might think about doing?,1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2505,So I think it should be really supportive of that then.,1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2506,So what would you do to make sure you didn't get hungry at work?,1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2507,"Yeah. Well, a big bowl of vegetable soup. You could probably count that as one or maybe even two of your five a day. So it'd be a really good place to start. Anything else you could think about doing?",1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2508,"Well, that's good. That's probably benefited you already. And the other thing you might not be aware of is that salt intake is linked to loss of calcium from our bones, which makes the bones more fragile. So reducing your salt intake will really help with that too.",1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2509,"So well, maybe you can help her as well and that would be good. Well, I think you've got off to a really great start, Mr. Green. You're very well aware of what you-you need to do, and you've obviously thought about it and got some good plans in place. So you're going to reduce your-your alcohol intake, you've already started by reducing your salt intake. Um, perhaps when we meet up next time we could talk a little bit about smoking and exercise as well, when you're ready for that. So how do you feel now?",1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2510,That's great. So should we meet up at the same time next week then?,1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2511,That’s great. All the very best then.,1,diet; reducing alcohol consumption; diabetes management
2512,"Thanks for coming in today. I guess you've, uh, sat in that seat with lots of people like me in the past.",1,reducing recidivism
2513,Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.,1,reducing recidivism
2514,"And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about—",1,reducing recidivism
2515,Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-,1,reducing recidivism
2516,So tell me how you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have you been managing to-to-to—,1,reducing recidivism
2517,It's there and-and-and you've a lot of contacts?,1,reducing recidivism
2518,"You've been in the system, so lots of context. So this isn't a new challenge for you.",1,reducing recidivism
2519,So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?,1,reducing recidivism
2520,22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.,1,reducing recidivism
2521,"Right. So the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?",1,reducing recidivism
2522,Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.,1,reducing recidivism
2523,Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.,1,reducing recidivism
2524,Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-,1,reducing recidivism
2525,"No. Well, I've-I've got lots of ideas, but I'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.",1,reducing recidivism
2526,"But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?",1,reducing recidivism
2527,"12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?",1,reducing recidivism
2528,Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.,1,reducing recidivism
2529,"Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?",1,reducing recidivism
2530,Okay. So what's Fiona want you from you?,1,reducing recidivism
2531,"She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?",1,reducing recidivism
2532,Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?,1,reducing recidivism
2533,So what's it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?,1,reducing recidivism
2534,"All right. Well, let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said, ""This is him""?",1,reducing recidivism
2535,"Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time.",1,reducing recidivism
2536,"Um, but that's okay. So-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and things have changed, but she's still with you?",1,reducing recidivism
2537,"Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?",1,reducing recidivism
2538,Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that is—,1,reducing recidivism
2539,"Second, I'd like to talk, Daryl, about this all- whole idea, that's this crossroads idea, yep? So on the one hand here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go. So, in that 'where to go', what ideas have you been thinking about in terms of where this-this Daryl, non-dealing [crosstalk] guy—",1,reducing recidivism
2540,"Okay. Yep. So a part of you knows you need to go something different, but the direction doesn't seem to be that clear at the moment?",1,reducing recidivism
2541,"No idea. Okay. So I'm wondering, you've been in the system a while. You're now 34, is it right from the pick-up?",1,reducing recidivism
2542,"Yeah. So, you know, often at 34, guys start to think about being with a girl in their life and what's important. And-and you would have also been part- not as a guy, so they've actually made some shifts and changes and thought, ""Time to move on"".",1,reducing recidivism
2543,"No, I'm not suggesting you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made that transition from-from being involved in crime-",1,reducing recidivism
2544,#NAME?,1,reducing recidivism
2545,"Okay, no 12-step higher power idea?",1,reducing recidivism
2546,"So that might work for him, but what might work for you?",1,reducing recidivism
2547,"Okay, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for that-",1,reducing recidivism
2548,"Well, it's a search, isn't it?",1,reducing recidivism
2549,"Yep, it is a big ask. So what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?",1,reducing recidivism
2550,Yet you're sitting here with me today-,1,reducing recidivism
2551,"Well, you're sitting here, and you're talking with me-",1,reducing recidivism
2552,'Cause you could've come in here and said-,1,reducing recidivism
2553,#VALUE!,1,reducing recidivism
2554,Well you said before you had an opportunity to pick up and start dealing again.,1,reducing recidivism
2555,"And-and so-so-so there's opportunities- there's opportunities in one world, and I'm wondering about what might make it hard to see opportunities in a different world?",1,reducing recidivism
2556,"Sure, sure. You're in the system-",1,reducing recidivism
2557,"-you're not in the system. Pick up that, where is it gonna take you?",1,reducing recidivism
2558,"Yeah, what-what's gonna happen if you start dealing again?",1,reducing recidivism
2559,"So-So again, I'm-I'm wondering about this other world, and you're saying it doesn't look to attractive at the moment.",1,reducing recidivism
2560,Yeah? You just described to me how it looked like a minute ago.,1,reducing recidivism
2561,"Sure. We talked about courage before and you've got the guts to be talking with me about this stuff today, and I'm wondering if you actually do have some courage to think about these ideas. I'm not saying that pumping gas at minimum wage is where you wanna go, but-but the guts to actually start steeping into this other world. I wonder if you do have, I'm-I'm-I'm just not sure.",1,reducing recidivism
2562,"Maybe. You're not convinced at the moment, I understand that and, um—",1,reducing recidivism
2563,"Sure. Well, it's hard to me to convince you-",1,reducing recidivism
2564,"-'cause this is your life and this is your story, and you-you've got to walk your life and I can't walk your life for you. I only walk my. And so, but I can walk with you on this life to try and think about-- 'Cause I-I-- You know, I-I've no interest in actually you falling over and going back into-into a lifestyle a crime 'cause I know where it'll take you. And I'm hearing that with your relationship, where it's going to take your relationship too, [unintelligible 00:16:39] got the bottom line drawn pretty clearly.",1,reducing recidivism
2565,Not part of on the wire?,1,reducing recidivism
2566,You don't. And who's sitting on the porch with you?,1,reducing recidivism
2567,Cool. So I'm picking up this world actually has the freedom to you to be your own man?,1,reducing recidivism
2568,"Absolutely massive. And, uh-- So, is there a challenge you're up to, to start creating some-some-some of that sort of world for Fiona? 'Cause I'm hearing that—",1,reducing recidivism
2569,"Sure. So what I'm hearing is, you're not convinced at the moment.",1,reducing recidivism
2570,"No. So what would convince you to-to make that shift? 'Cause I hear a lot of kind of-- And in this hard, like, y-you've done time and then once you've got a record, the employers- you know, we know, I know that. That's-that's not easy. You can't just wonder into a job, a high-paying job and go, ""Pick me, pick me, pick me."" I know that.",1,reducing recidivism
2571,"Well, you trying to get a job, maybe and get into some routine.",1,reducing recidivism
2572,"Yeah. I'm confused though at the moment because you're saying, ""Yeah, I could make in a night what you make in a week,"" but you've haven't. 22-22 days-",1,reducing recidivism
2573,"Oh, it's a decision whether it's right or wrong-- It's not gonna be-",1,reducing recidivism
2574,"Yeah, you're that kinda guy okay, so once you make a decision. So you made a decision that you're not gonna- you're not gonna go back to dealing?",1,reducing recidivism
2575,"-at the moment, is what I'm picking up.",1,reducing recidivism
2576,"Yeah, okay, so that will be a call you-you've got to make.",1,reducing recidivism
2577,"I'm-I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna make that call. You'll make that call, but there's a consequence of making that call, and there's big consequences more time probably and Fiona not being around. On the other hand, what I'm picking up is a call to-to do some- do some stuff that may not be racy and exciting and in the big dollars, but me being with Fiona and engaging in this transition into a-a different life.",1,reducing recidivism
2578,So how much time have you been talking about this-,1,reducing recidivism
2579,"Okay-okay, so the fact we're even having a conversation about it, it's kind of interesting?",1,reducing recidivism
2580,"Yeah, so I wanna summarize, Daryl, what-what I picked up so far and then just so I make sure I'm really listening to you well 'cause it's important, isn't it? 'Cause, you know, it's important you're listened to-",1,reducing recidivism
